      "A question is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information, which is expected to be provided in the form of an answer. Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Definitions ==\n",
      "Linguistically, a question may be defined on three levels.\n",
      "At the level of semantics, a question is defined by its ability to establish a set of logically possible answers.At the level of pragmatics, a question is an illocutionary category of speech act which seeks to obtain information from the addressee.At the level of syntax, the interrogative is a type of clause which is characteristically associated with questions, and defined by certain grammatical rules (such as subject–auxiliary inversion in English) which vary by language.\n",
      "Some authors conflate these definitions. While prototypical questions (such as \"What is your name?\") will satisfy all three definitions, their overlap is not complete. For example \"I would like to know your name.\" satisfies the pragmatic definition, but not the semantic or syntactic ones. Such mismatches of form and function are called indirect speech acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Uses ==\n",
      "The principal use of questions is to elicit information from the person being addressed by indicating the information which the speaker (or writer) desires.A slight variant is the display question, where the addressee is asked to produce information which is already known to the speaker. For example, a teacher or game show host might ask \"What is the capital of Australia?\" to test the knowledge of a student or contestant.\n",
      "A direction question is one that seeks an instruction rather than factual information. It differs from a typical (\"information\") question in that the characteristic response is a directive rather than a declarative statement. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "A: When should I open your gift?\n",
      "B: Open it now.Questions may also be used as the basis for a number of indirect speech acts. For example, the imperative sentence \"Pass the salt.\" can be reformulated (somewhat more politely) as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you pass the salt?Which has the form of an interrogative, but the illocutionary force of a directive.\n",
      "The term rhetorical question may be colloquially applied to a number of uses of questions where the speaker does not seek or expect an answer (perhaps because the answer is implied or obvious), such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he lost his mind?\n",
      "Why have I brought you all here? Let me explain...\n",
      "They're closed? But the website said it was open until 10 o'clock.Loaded questions (a special case of complex questions), such as \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Semantic classification ==\n",
      "The main semantic classification of questions is according to the set of logically possible answers that they admit. An open question, such as \"What is your name?\", allows indefinitely many possible answers. A closed question admits a finite number of possible answers. Closed questions may be further subdivided into yes–no questions (such as \"Are you hungry?\") and alternative questions (such as \"Do you want jam or marmalade?\").\n",
      "The distinction between these classes tends to be grammaticalized. In English, open and closed interrogatives are distinct clause types characteristically associated with open and closed questions, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Yes–no questions ===\n",
      "\n",
      "A yes–no question (also called a polar question, or general question) asks whether some statement is true. They can in principle be answered by a \"yes\" or \"no\" (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include \"Do you take sugar?\", \"Should they be believed?\" and \"Am I the loneliest person in the world?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Alternative questions ===\n",
      "An alternative question presents two or more discrete choices as possible answers in an assumption that only one of them is true. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?The canonical expected answer to such a question would be either \"England\", \"Ireland\", or \"Wales\". Such an alternative question presupposes that the addressee supports one of these three teams. The addressee may cancel this presupposition with an answer like \"None of them\".\n",
      "In English, alternative questions are not syntactically distinguished from yes–no questions. Depending on context, the same question may have either interpretation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I'm on a low fat diet.]\n",
      "Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I saw that the recipe said you could use either.]In speech, these are distinguishable by intonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Open questions ===\n",
      "An open question (also called a variable question, non-polar question, or special question) admits indefinitely many possible answers. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Where should we go for lunch?In English, these are typically embodied in a closed interrogative clause, which uses an interrogative word such as when, who, or what. These are also called wh-words, and for this reason open questions may also be called wh-questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Question formation ==\n",
      "Questions may be marked by some combination of word order, morphology, interrogative words, and intonation. Where languages have one or more clause type characteristically used to form questions, they are called interrogative clauses. Open and closed questions are generally distinguished grammatically, with the former identified by the use of interrogative words.\n",
      "In English, German, French and various other (mostly European) languages, both forms of interrogative are subject to an inversion of word order between verb and subject. In English, the inversion is limited to auxiliary verbs, which sometimes necessitates the addition of the auxiliary do, as in:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Sam reads the newspaper. - Statement\n",
      "b. Does Sam read the newspaper? - Yes–no question formed using inversion and do-support\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Open questions ===\n",
      "Open questions are formed by the use of interrogative words such as, in English, when, what, or which. These stand in as variables representing the unknown information being sought. They may also combine with other words to form interrogative phrases, such as which shoes in:\n",
      "\n",
      "Which shoes should I wear to the party?In many languages, including English and most other European languages, the interrogative phrase must (with certain exceptions such as echo questions) appear at the beginning of the sentence, a phenomenon known as wh-fronting. In other languages, the interrogative appears in the same position as it would in a corresponding declarative sentence (in situ).A question may include multiple variables as in:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose gifts are in which boxes?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Polar questions ===\n",
      "Different languages may use different mechanisms to distinguish polar (\"yes-no\") questions from declarative statements (in addition to the question mark). English is one of a small number of languages which use word order. Another example is French:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-linguistically, the most common method of marking a polar question is with an interrogative particle, such as the Japanese か ka, Mandarin 吗 ma and Polish czy.\n",
      "Other languages use verbal morphology, such as the -n verbal postfix in the Tunica language.\n",
      "Of the languages examined in the World Atlas of Language Structures, only one, Atatláhuca–San Miguel Mixtec, was found to have no distinction between declaratives and polar questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Intonation ====\n",
      "Most languages have an intonational pattern which is characteristic of questions (often involving a raised pitch at the end, as in English).\n",
      "In some languages, such as Italian, intonation is the sole distinction.In some languages, such as English, or Russian, a rising declarative is a sentence which is syntactically declarative but is understood as a question by the use of a rising intonation. For example, \"You're not using this?\"\n",
      "On the other hand, there are English dialects (Southern Californian English, New Zealand English) in which rising declaratives (the \"uptalk\") do not constitute questions. However it is established that that in English there is a distinction between assertive rising declaratives and inquisitive rising declaratives, distinguished by their prosody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Request for confirmation and speaker presupposition ====\n",
      "Questions may be phrased as a request for confirmation for a statement the interrogator already believes to be true.\n",
      "A tag question is a polar question formed by the addition of an interrogative fragment (the \"tag\") to a (typically declarative) clause. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "You're John, aren't you?\n",
      "Let's have a drink, shall we?\n",
      "You remembered the eggs, right?This form may incorporate speaker's presupposition when it constitutes a complex question.\n",
      "Consider a statement\n",
      "\n",
      "(A) Somebody killed the catand several questions related to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(B) John killed the cat, did he?  (tag question)\n",
      "(C) Was it John who killed the cat?As compared with:\n",
      "\n",
      "(D) Who killed the cat?Unlike (B), questions (C) and (D) incorporate a presupposition that somebody killed the cat.\n",
      "Question (C) indicates speaker's commitment to the truth of the statement that somebody killed the cat, but no commitment as to whether John did it or didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Punctuation ===\n",
      "In languages written in Latin, Cyrillic or certain other scripts, a question mark at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions – it may also indicate a sentence's pragmatic function.\n",
      "In Spanish an additional inverted mark is placed at the beginning: ¿Cómo está usted? \"How are you?\". An uncommon variant of the question mark is the interrobang (‽), which combines the function of the question mark and the exclamation mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Responses and answers ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language distinguishes between an answer (being a member of the set of logically possible answers, as delineated in § Semantic classification) and a response (any statement made by the addressee in reply to the question). For example, the following are all possible responses to the question \"Is Alice ready to leave?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "i.  (a) Yes.\n",
      "    (b) She's ready.\n",
      "    (c) No, she's not.\n",
      "ii. (a) I don't know.\n",
      "    (b) Why do you ask?\n",
      "    (c) She might be.\n",
      "iii.(a) She's still looking for her wallet.\n",
      "    (b) She wasn't expecting you before 5 o'clock.\n",
      "    (c) I'll let you know when she's ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the [i] responses are true answers. The responses in [ii] avoid committing to a yes or no answer. The responses in [iii] all implicate an answer of no, but are not logically equivalent to no. (For example, in [iiib], the respondent can cancel the implicature by adding a statement like: \"Fortunately, she packed everything up early.\")\n",
      "Along similar lines, Belnap and Steel (1976) define the concept of a direct answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "A direct answer to a given question is a piece of language that completely, but just completely, answers the question...What is crucial is that it be effectively decidable whether a piece of language is a direct answer to a specific question... To each clear question there corresponds a set of statements which are directly responsive. ... A direct answer must provide an unarguably final resolution of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Answering negative questions ===\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Negative questions\" are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as \"Shouldn't you be working?\" These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both \"Do you have a passport?\" and \"Don't you have a passport?\" are properly answered with \"No\", despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering \"No\" to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, \"I do have a passport\".\n",
      "A similar ambiguous question in English is \"Do you mind if...?\" The responder may reply unambiguously \"Yes, I do mind,\" if they do mind, or \"No, I don't mind,\" if they don't, but a simple \"No\" or \"Yes\" answer can lead to confusion, as a single \"No\" can seem like a \"Yes, I do mind\" (as in \"No, please don't do that\"), and a \"Yes\" can seem like a \"No, I don't mind\" (as in \"Yes, go ahead\"). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as \"Is it all right with you if...?\"\n",
      "Some languages have different particles (for example the French \"si\", the German \"doch\" or the Danish and Norwegian \"jo\") to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Indirect questions ==\n",
      "As well as direct questions (such as Where are my keys?), there also exist indirect questions (also called interrogative content clauses), such as where my keys are. These are used as subordinate clauses in sentences such as \"I wonder where my keys are\" and \"Ask him where my keys are.\" Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions. For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in \"where are they?\" and \"(I wonder) where they are\"). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of tense and other changes that apply generally to indirect speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Learning ==\n",
      "Questions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research.  In the scientific method, a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages.  Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating \"investigatable\" questions is a central part of inquiry education.  The Socratic method of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.\n",
      "A widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students' knowledge through exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Origins ==\n",
      "Enculturated apes Kanzi, Washoe, Sarah and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs (with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications) successfully learned to answer quite complex questions and requests (including question words \"who\", \"what\", \"where\"), although so far they have failed to learn how to ask questions themselves. For example, David and Anne Premack wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions — unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\". The ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures. It is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of language development, with the use of question intonation.\n",

The story is a loose adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story \"The Black Cat\" and follows a vaudeville impersonator who becomes an assistant to a mad scientist. Promoted as a documentary on mental illness, Maniac was criticized for its gratuitous footage of women undressing and for taking horror sequences from the 1922 silent film Häxan. Danny Peary believes that Maniac is the worst film ever made, Charlie Jane Anders of Gawker Media's io9 described it as \"possibly the worst movie in history\" and Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington wrote that it may be the worst film he had ever seen, writing: \"There are some voyages into ineptitude, like Dwain Esper's anti-classic Maniac, that defy all reason.\" Rotten Tomatoes placed Maniac on their list of movies \"So Bad They're Unmissable\", the Italian Vanity Fair included the film on its list of the 20 worst movies ever, and it is featured in The Official Razzie Movie Guide.\n",

Pacific Standard wrote that Reefer Madness was \"one of the first films ever to be considered transcendentally bad\" and Leonard Maltin has called it \"the grand-daddy of all 'Worst' movies\". Las Vegas CityLife named it the \"worst ever\" runner-up to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and News.com.au considered it a \"disastrous flop turned cult classic\" due to its \"terrible acting and exaggerated drug-addicted stereotypes\".

In 1978, it was included in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time and has since been listed as one of the worst films ever made by Flavorwire, Rotten Tomatoes,  and The Golden Turkey Awards. Melvin Defleur referred to it as \"Perhaps the worst film of all time\", and critic Gabriel Ricard listed it as the worst film ever made; stating, \"not only is it pretty terrible, but Tiny Town is also pretty endearing.\" In 1986, The Terror of Tiny Town was the first film featured on Canned Film Festival, a late night television show featuring the worst movies ever made.\n",

      "\n",
      "No Orchids for Miss Blandish, a British gangster film adapted from the 1939 novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film's high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James) was seen as unconvincing. The British film journal Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen\". The Sunday Express film reviewer called No Orchids for Miss Blandish \"the worst film I have ever seen\". The Australian newspaper The Age also gave a harsh review: \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole ... the entire production is unpardonable.\" Cliff Goodwin, discussing No Orchids For Miss Blandish's initial reception, notes it was \"unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made'\". Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. No Orchids for Miss Blandish was described by British film reviewer Leslie Halliwell as a \"hilariously awful gangster film ... one of the worst films ever made\". Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide states that No Orchids for Miss Blandish \"aspires to be a Hollywood film noir and misses by a mile.\"\n",

The New York Times describes it as \"the Plan 9 from Outer Space of baseball biopics\". It was rushed into release while Ruth was still alive. In the final scene, Ruth delivers on a promise he made to a young cancer patient that he would hit a home run. Not only does Ruth succeed in fulfilling the promise, but also the child is subsequently cured of his cancer. Baseball player Ted Williams believed it to be the worst movie he had ever seen and The Washington Times stated that it \"stands as possibly the worst movie ever made\". The film has been called one of the worst sports films ever by Newsday and The A.V. Club, and called one of the worst biopics by Moviefone and Spike.

      "A semi-autobiographical quasi-documentary about transvestism, Glen or Glenda starred and was directed by Ed Wood. After a nightmarish dream sequence, Glen undergoes psychotherapy to help \"cure\" him of his transvestism. Bela Lugosi appears in this film, as he did in several other Wood films toward the end of his career. Leonard Maltin insists this was far worse than Wood's later Plan 9 from Outer Space and considers it \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Richard Barrios describes Glen or Glenda as \"one of the funniest and worst movies ever made\". In his book Cult Movies 3, Danny Peary suggests this is actually a radical, if ineptly made, film that presents a far more personal story than is contained in films by more well-respected auteurs, and it was taken seriously and seen as a significant work by Steve Jenkins, writing for The Monthly Film Bulletin when the film was finally released in the UK in 1981.

It is also featured in The Book of Lists' 10 worst movies list, and in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. The Golden Turkey Awards confers on its main character the title of \"Most Ridiculous Monster in Screen History\" and, listing director Tucker among the runners-up to \"Worst Director of All Time\" (the winner being Ed Wood), states, \"What made Robot Monster ineffably worse than any other low-budget sci-fi epic was its bizarre artistic pretension\". It was featured in an episode of the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000, and was fondly remembered by author Stephen King, who quotes, and agrees with, a review in Castle of Frankenstein magazine (\"certainly among the finest terrible movies ever made\", \"one of the most laughable poverty row quickies\").\n",

      "Howard Hughes funded The Conqueror, an epic film featuring John Wayne as Mongolian chieftain Genghis Khan and the redheaded Susan Hayward as a Tatar princess. The movie was filmed near St. George, Utah, downwind from a nuclear testing range in Nevada, and is often blamed for the cancer deaths of many of the cast and crew, including Hayward, Wayne, Agnes Moorehead, Pedro Armendáriz, and director Dick Powell. In addition to filming near the testing range, truckloads of the red sands were transported back to the studios for interior scenes. The film made the ten-worst list in The Book of Lists, appears in Michael Sauter's book The Worst Movies of All Time, and was among those listed in Michael Medved's book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Originally written for Marlon Brando, The Guardian called the choice of Wayne for Khan \"one of the worst casting decisions of all time\". Complex listed The Conqueror as the worst biopic ever made.Hughes, one of the world's wealthiest people at the time, had previously produced the successful dramatic films Hell's Angels, Scarface, and The Outlaw. After seeing The Conqueror himself, Hughes bought every existing print for $12 million and refused to let the film be seen on television until 1974, reportedly out of guilt over the decision to shoot at such a hazardous location. By 1980, 91 of the 220 cast and crew members had been diagnosed with cancer, over 41%. This was the last film Hughes produced.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fire Maidens from Outer Space, a low-budget British space opera film (known in the US as Fire Maidens of Outer Space), is about a group of astronauts visiting an all-female society on a moon of Jupiter. This film developed a negative reputation for its poor special effects (including a scene on the alien planet in which an automobile is visible driving past). Leslie Halliwell described Fire Maidens from Outer Space as \"a strong contender for the title of the worst movie ever made, with diaphanously clad English gals striking embarrassed poses against cardboard sets\". British film historian I.Q. Hunter included it in his list of candidates for \"the worst British film ever made\". The DVD Talk website's review claimed it \"may be among the worst-ever professionally produced science fiction films\". In November 1992, the film was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n",

      "=== Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space was labeled the \"Worst Film Ever\" by The Golden Turkey Awards. This movie marked the final film appearance of Bela Lugosi. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by Tom Mason, the chiropractor of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face.\n",
      "Wood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi – such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died. Worst of all, Mason could not do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and kitschy dialogue. Wood's characteristically cavalier attitude toward continuity – night suddenly changing to day, automobile models suddenly changing – makes the film difficult to follow.\n",
      "Shot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor. It has played at the New Orleans Worst Film Festival. In 1994, Tim Burton directed Ed Wood, which includes some material about the trials and tribulations of making Plan 9. Phil Hall of Film Threat calls it \"far too entertaining to be considered as the very worst film ever made\". Likewise, John Wirt of The Advocate goes as far as to call it \"the ultimate cult flick\", and Videohound's Complete Guide to Cult Flicks and Trash Pics states, \"In fact, the film has become so famous for its own badness that it's now beyond criticism.\" Ian Berriman of SFX commented about the unintentional comedy, \"Some things are best watched at 3 am, wrapped in the warm glow of drunkenness ... Plan 9 From Outer Space is one of them.\" The Radio Times Guide to Films described Plan 9 as \"the worst film ever made\" and \"tediously depressing\".\n",

The film is memorable for its use of some bargain-basement effects: stock footage of a rocket launch played in reverse to depict the landing of an alien spacecraft, and the \"monster\" appears to be composed of a length of shag carpet draped over several actors.

The New York Times film review stated, \"The most to be said for him is that he has not stinted on the gore.\" Thomas Lisanti in Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959–1969 called it \"by far the worst of the sixties beach films\", and Stephen King called it \"an abysmal little wet fart of a film\". Joe Meyers in the Hearst newspaper blog for the Stamford Advocate said on Del Tenney's passing: \"Connecticut had its own Ed Wood, an actor, director and entrepreneur named Del Tenney who made a series of truly awful pictures in the Stamford area during the 1960s, the most notorious of which is Horror of Party Beach, a 1964 drive-in quickie about an atomic mutation that terrorizes Stamford ('Party Beach' was actually Shippan Point).\" It is also listed in Michael Sauter's book The Worst Movies of All Time.\n",

      "The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (sometimes billed as The Incredibly Strange Creatures) is a 1964 American monster movie written and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym \"Cash Flagg\". In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble onto a group of occultists and disfigured monsters. Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn's Coney Island. The film was billed as the first \"monster musical\", beating out The Horror of Party Beach by a mere month in release date. The 2004 DVD The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made listed this film as the worst film of all time. The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about Incredibly Strange Creatures in which he tries to explain and justify the movie's value: \"This flick doesn't just rebel against, or even disregard, standards of taste and art. In the universe inhabited by The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, such things as standards and responsibility have never been heard of. It is this lunar purity which largely imparts to the film its classic stature. Like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and a very few others, it will remain as an artifact in years to come to which scholars and searchers for truth can turn and say, 'This was trash!'\"\n",

      "Monster a Go-Go! began as Terror at Halfday by Bill Rebane. The production ran out of money and the film was abandoned. Herschell Gordon Lewis, who reportedly needed a second feature to comprise a double bill, purchased and completed it for a minimal amount of money. Several of the film's actors were unable to return, so Lewis simply replaced their parts with new characters who mysteriously appear and fill the roles of the missing characters. One of the actors Lewis managed to rehire had gained weight, gone bald, and grown a goatee, so Lewis recast him as the brother of the original character. The picture consists mostly of lengthy dialogue sequences concerning the apparent mutation of an astronaut into a monster portrayed by the 231 cm (7 ft 6¾ in) tall Henry Hite. Poor audio quality makes much of the dialogue unintelligible, and when the film is overexposed, several characters' faces appear as bright white, glowing circles. During the climax of the movie, as soldiers prepare to confront the mutated astronaut, he abruptly vanishes and the narrator informs the audience, \"there was no monster\", and that the astronaut has, in fact, been in the Atlantic Ocean the entire time. All Movie Guide calls the film a \"surreal anti-masterpiece\". It was also featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where writer Paul Chaplin called the dialogue \"garbled beyond recognition\". The entire cast of the show later stated it was officially the worst movie they had ever seen.\n",

      "The low-budget horror film Manos: The Hands of Fate, made by El Paso insurance and fertilizer salesman Hal P. Warren, concerns a vacationing family kidnapped by a polygamous cult of pagans. The film was conceived after Warren bet Academy Award-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant that anyone could make a horror movie. Warren was convinced by the film's cinematographer and stunt coordinator that most of its glaring mistakes could be fixed in a Dallas post-production studio, when in reality the two wanted to quickly wrap the production because they were not being paid. Several technical gaffes made it into the film, including scenes filmed out of focus, a marking slate being seen in one shot, the scarf on the female lead's head disappearing and reappearing, and an insect bumping the camera lens. The film was shot with a camera that could not record sound and had a 32-second maximum shot length. All dialogue was later dubbed by Warren and four others, including a grown woman who dubbed the voice for a seven-year-old girl. It opens with a nine-minute driving scene that the filmmakers intended to use for cast and crew credits, but failed to do so.The movie includes dialogue spoken while all characters are facing away from the camera, a character complaining about it getting dark while the sun is brightly shining, and the character Torgo, a satyr with overly large thighs, that three women attempt to massage to death. The film gained notoriety and cult popularity by being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and was the show's most popular episode. The film has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Entertainment Weekly says the movie is \"widely regarded as, quite simply, the worst movie ever made\". Even Warren himself would later admit his film was one of the worst ever, suggesting it might make a passable comedy if redubbed. The film was later restored and released on Blu-ray in 2015.\n",

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it the \"most godawful piece of pseudo-romantic slop I've ever seen!\" and Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times referred to it as \"the worst movie I have seen all year and possibly since 1926\".

      "The 1970 comedy film Myra Breckinridge, based on the book of the same name by Gore Vidal, directed by Michael Sarne and starring Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Mae West, John Huston and Farrah Fawcett, provoked controversy due to a scene in which Welch forcibly sodomizes a bound man while clips from various classic films play onscreen. The film was initially rated X before edits and an appeal to the MPAA brought it down to an R. It also used the technique of inserting clips from Golden Age movies in such a way that the dialogue took on sexual undertones. Several stars whose films were featured objected to the gimmick such as Loretta Young who sued to remove the footage from the 1939 film The Story of Alexander Graham Bell. The film was a critical failure, with Time magazine saying \"Myra Breckinridge is about as funny as a child molester\". Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB (the lowest score possible) and stated that it was \"as bad as any movie ever made\". The Miami News critic Herb Kelly nominated Myra Breckinridge as the worst film ever made. The film is also cited in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time.

The film follows a Nazi mad scientist who injects himself with a formula that turns him into a mutated catfish. Florida Times-Union critic Matt Soergel quipped that Zaat \"could very well be the best film ever made about a mutated catfish\". Critic Jeffrey Kauffman said, \"this is the sort of film Ed Wood, Jr. might have made—on a bad day\" and added, \"Lovers of fantastically bad films rate Zaat one of the worst\".

Possessing no credits or copyright information, there is no known record of Bat Pussy's existence prior to the mid-1990s, when it was discovered in the storeroom of an adult movie theater in Memphis, Tennessee, and subsequently released on home video by exploitation film distributor Something Weird Video.

ALL pornography\", deriding its \"obese redneck\" cast as rendering the film \"wank-proof\". PornParody.com, a website dedicated to pornographic parody films, acknowledged its status as \"the worst adult movie of all time\", describing Bat Pussy as \"renowned for its technical ineptness and anti-eroticism\" due to its \"physically unappealing\" actors. AV Maniacs contested Bat Pussy's categorization as pornography on the grounds of the lead actor's visible impotence and instead labeled the film \"anti-porn\", asking \"How else do you categorize an adult film that completely and utterly fails to elicit even the minutest amount of arousal in its viewers?\" The book The Many More Lives of Batman by William Uricchio and Will Brooker also labeled Bat Pussy \"the worst porn film ever made\", criticizing its poor adaptation of the source material, while Tim Lewis, the general manager of Something Weird Video, selected Bat Pussy as the one film \"so nuts it has to be seen to be believed\" out of the company's entire catalog, saying it was \"only for the truly jaded adult film viewer\".\n",

The Hair tells the story of a middle-aged man who becomes deeply involved with the affairs and criminal connections of a mysterious girl. Critics were scathing in their reviews. Eeva Järvenpää from Helsingin Sanomat summed up her assessment: “The Hair is trying to offer sex and humor, a show and momentum, violence and drama. In all of this, it fails miserably.” Timo Malmi from Ilta-Sanomat considers the film to be one of the \"worst Finnish films ever\" and in his assessment calls the film's “plot so confusing and tense that its progression is not even interesting, and the \"alternative\" fantasy ending does not make the viewing experience any easier.” In connection with the 2011 DVD release, Janne Rosenqvist from Film-o-Holic site found something positive in the film as well: “At its best, The Hair offers smooth physical black comedy spiced with jazz, but the outright obsession with experimentation is too much of a burden.”\n",

Esquire film critic John Simon said, \"it may be the worst movie musical of this – or any – decade\". Buffalo News film critic Jeff Simon wrote, \"About 45 minutes in, it became apparent to one and all that this was one of the worst and most embarrassing major-talent turkeys of all time.\" Film critic Jay Cocks has said the film was \"regarded as the great white elephant catastrophe of its time\".

It is also included in the Golden Turkey Awards Nominees and Winners, the Worst Achievements in Hollywood History. Bogdanovich, who was also the screenwriter, sent press releases to newspapers across the country apologizing for this film.One defender of the film was Roger Ebert, who stated, \"The movie's no masterpiece, but I can't account for the viciousness of some of the critical attacks against it.\" He continued, \"It's a light, silly, impeccably stylish entertainment ... if [Bogdanovich] doesn't go spectacularly right, at least he provides small pleasures and great music.\" In a recent documentary on his career, Bogdanovich lamented being influenced by studio previews to cut the film before its theatrical release. He subsequently recut it again before it debuted on cable TV the next year. A fan of the film, a studio editor who preferred the director's first cut, secretly saved that original version and quietly put it in place of the others. When news of this version streaming on Netflix reached Bogdanovich, he contacted Fox and made a few finishing touches, resulting in a critically acclaimed director's cut that debuted on home video in 2013.\n",

      "The infamous 1979 erotic/historical drama Caligula, directed by Tinto Brass, about the infamous Roman Emperor was in part financed by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione. The film, featuring a prestigious cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud) is notable for its explicit scenes of sex and violence, including six minutes of hardcore porn footage filmed by Guccione and another editor. Caligula earned some prerelease controversy after Gore Vidal, who had written the script, distanced himself from the film. When Caligula was released, it received strongly hostile reviews, reviewers criticizing its extreme scenes of sex and violence and lack of narrative coherence. Rex Reed of New York magazine called the film a \"trough of rotten swill\". Roger Ebert gave Caligula a zero stars rating, dubbing it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\", accusing it of being artistically vulgar in its depiction of sex and violence, and of having technically incompetent direction and structure. Caligula was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out on (two hours into its 170-minute running time), after describing himself as feeling \"disgusted and unspeakably depressed\", and he also placed it on his \"Most Hated\" list.Jay Scott, reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail, stated, \"Caligula doesn't really work on any level\" and the film and its production \"constitute a boondoggle of landmark proportions\". So negative was its initial reception, Australian newspaper The Age stated that Caligula was being \"billed by critics everywhere as one of the worst films ever made\". Leslie Halliwell dubbed it \"a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sadomasochists\". The Hamilton Spectator later referred to Caligula as \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Joe Holleman, in an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch discussing historical films set in Ancient Rome, argued, \"two of the worst movies made in the 20th century were ancient Rome pieces ... Cleopatra and Caligula\". Christopher Armstead, reviewing Caligula for the website Film Critics United, stated, \"Dollar for dollar, this could very well be the worst movie ever made.\"\n",

      "=== Heaven's Gate (theatrical version, 1980) ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The Western epic Heaven's Gate, loosely based on the Johnson County War in 1890s Wyoming, was plagued by massive cost and time overruns, largely due to director Michael Cimino's extreme attention to detail. He demanded 50 takes of at least one scene, and refused to start shooting for another until a cloud he liked rolled across the sky. It cost over $44 million, but brought in only $3.5 million at the box office. The original version ran at nearly four hours, but was yanked from release after only one week due to scathing reviews. It later resurfaced in a 149-minute version, but by then the damage was done. Vincent Canby called it \"an unqualified disaster\", among other things. Roger Ebert called it \"the most scandalous cinematic waste I've ever seen\".After word of his grandiose spending and defiant nature toward studio United Artists got out (detailed in Final Cut by Steven Bach, a studio executive involved with the film from the beginning). Cimino was awarded the 1980 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film was nominated for four more Razzies, including Worst Picture. In 1999, Time placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century. In February 2010, the readers of Empire voted it the sixth-worst film of all time. That same year, Joe Queenan of The Guardian also called it the worst film ever made, saying that it \"defies belief\". Cimino was initially considered a director on the rise after directing The Deer Hunter (which won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director), but his reputation never recovered after Heaven's Gate. The production is also notorious for the cruelty to animals that occurred both on screen and on site, including deliberately killing a horse with explosives. The film effectively ended not only the existence of United Artists as an independent Hollywood studio (its parent firm sold the company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where it still operates), but also, largely, Cimino's career—he would not direct again until 1985's Year of the Dragon.\n",
      "Despite the vicious reviews, the film's reputation improved over time. In fall 2012, the New York Film Festival, the venue for its infamous opening, premiered the restored director's cut. In stark contrast, The Times (London) called the restored version \"a modern masterpiece\" and its 1980 cut \"one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history\". The film has also been released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that the film \"has been called a disaster and a disgrace, yet also anointed a masterpiece.\"\n",

      "The Apple (also called Star Rock) is a 1980 science fiction musical comedy film written and directed by Menahem Golan. It stars Catherine Mary Stewart as a young singer named Bibi, who, in a futuristic 1994, signs to an evil label named Boogalow International Music. It deals with themes of conformity versus rebellion, and makes use of Biblical allegory including the tale of Adam and Eve.\n",
      "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 20% score based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 3.99/10. Common criticism from both reviews that appeared in trade publications and major news outlets and the audience were a lack of originality, a weak script, uninspired music, poor execution, and Golan's inexperienced take on the 1960s hippie movement. At the 1980 Montreal World Film Festival, some watchers threw vinyl records of music from the film at the screen. The Apple was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1980 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. The ballot was revised and re-released in 2006, where the Worst Picture results remained the same. In addition, the film received six more nominations, two of which were wins: Worst Director (Golan) and Least “Special” Special Effects. Sean Burns in the Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a scathing review: \"The Apple isn't just the worst disco musical ever made; it could very well be the worst movie ever made, period.\" For years, a poor transfer on VHS was the only viewing option for fans at midnight screenings, until 2004 when the cult film was finally released on DVD.\n",

      "\n",
      "The war film Inchon, directed by Terence Young and starring Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur, was meant to depict the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. Producer Mitsuharu Ishii was a senior member of the Japanese branch of the Unification Church, whose leader, Sun Myung Moon, claimed he had the film made to show MacArthur's spirituality and connection to God and the Japanese people. Its eventual production cost of $46 million resulted in a $5 million box office gross, and The New York Times review written by Vincent Canby calls the movie \"the most expensive B-movie ever\". The Washington Post described Inchon as \"one of the biggest commercial disasters in film history\". Every conceivable kind of problem plagued production, including labor issues, the U.S. military withdrawing support due to the film's Unification Church connection, weather and natural disasters, customs difficulties, expensive directorial blunders, and the original director (Andrew McLaglen) quitting before the start of production. Olivier's performance was criticised, and he was awarded the 1982 Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor. The film itself took the 1982 Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and Young's direction earned him a tie for Worst Director of 1982. A number of reviewers at various media outlets described Inchon as the worst film ever made, including The Washington Post, Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. To date, Inchon has never been released on home video in the United States although it was aired on the church's Good Life TV Network.\n",

      "The adventure film Tarzan, the Ape Man, loosely based on the novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, stars Miles O'Keefe (who would later become famous in the 1984 Conan the Barbarian knock-off Ator the Invincible alongside its sequel featured in two episodes of the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000) in the title role and Bo Derek as his partner Jane Parker, and is told from Jane's point of view. Despite being a box office success, it was poorly received by critics upon its release, due to its poor screenplay, bad acting, and unintentional humor. Leonard Maltin, writing for his Movie Guide, stated that the film \"lacks action, humor and charm\", and considered it so bad that it \"nearly forced editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB\". Leslie Halliwell was equally harsh; he described Tarzan, the Ape Man as \"certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the most banal film so far made; even the animals give poor performances\". Writer Thomas S. Hischak described it thus: \"Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, Tarzan, the Ape Man often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made.\" Film critic John Nesbit considered it \"my pick for worst film ever\", while Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote, \"this cinematic atrocity truly is one of the all-time worsts\". Tarzan, the Ape Man was nominated for six awards at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Actress (Bo Derek). It holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.\n",

It was the first film to sweep the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, winning a total of five Razzies out of the nine nominations, including \"Worst Picture\" and Worst Actress (Faye Dunaway, shared with Bo Derek). The same organization also named it \"Worst Picture of the Decade\" in 1989/90, and was nominated for \"Worst Drama of Our First 25 Years\" in 2004/05. The film is part of the \"100 most awful\" in the book The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst. Entertainment writer Michael Sauter included the film in his book The Worst Movies of All Time. It earned, as film critic and television host Richard Crouse put it, \"some of the nastiest reviews ever\". Eric Henderson of CBS Minneapolis named it at the top of his \"Best 'Worst Movies Ever'\" list. Roger Ebert wrote of this film, \"I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie. 'Mommie Dearest' is a painful experience that drones on endlessly, as Joan Crawford's relationship with her daughter, Christina, disintegrates from cruelty through jealousy into pathos.\" Of the performance of Faye Dunaway, Variety said \"Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, co-stars and all.\"Despite the reviews at the time, the film was a box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. It has a 49% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \"Mommie Dearest certainly doesn't lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaway's legendary performance as a wire-wielding monster; unfortunately, the movie is too campy and undisciplined to transcend guilty pleasure\".\n",

      "The Turkish science-fiction adventure Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (also commonly known as Turkish Star Wars) was directed by Çetin İnanç and starred Cüneyt Arkın. It is notorious for illegally using footage from well-known science fiction films and shows, most notably Star Wars, along with stealing the music score from films such as Moonraker and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film is also criticized for its nonsensical plot, badly written dialogue, and crude special effects. Jos Kirps of ArticlesBase called it \"The Worst Movie Ever\", and stated, \"There are many bad sci-fi movies, and for many years movie addicts even considered Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space the worst movie of all times. But Plan 9 is still a pretty good movie when compared to Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam.\" Sabah called it the \"world's worst film\". Hürriyet described the film as \"sitting on the throne of the king\" when compared to other \"so bad it's good\" cult films. Toronto Standard called it a \"dollar-store Star Wars\" and compared it to the works of Ed Wood. When it became apparent that the film had inspired an enthusiastic international cult, a sequel, The Son of the Man Who Saved the World (Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam'ın Oğlu), was shot in 2006 and featured many returning members of the original cast and crew.\n",

Roger Ebert opened his review saying that \"If The Lonely Lady had even a shred of style and humor, it could qualify as the worst movie of the year. Unfortunately, it's not that good.\" John J.B. Wilson included it in The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the most enjoyable bad movies ever, saying: \"In rough cut, The Lonely Lady was one of the funniest bad movies ever made.\" Dennis Schwartz called it \"A true candidate for one of the worst films ever.\" Zadora herself said that The Lonely Lady was \"a real turkey, done very badly\", that she \"knew it was bad all along\" and that despite being taken seriously by its director it became a \"camp classic, one of those movies that's so bad it's funny.\"The film was nominated for eleven Golden Raspberry Awards (a record at that time until being surpassed by Showgirls with 13 nominations) and won six: Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Musical Score, Worst Original Song (\"The Way You Do It\"), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. It was the first movie to win more than five Razzies. It was also nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture as well as for a Razzie for Worst Picture of the Decade, but lost to Mommie Dearest, and for Worst Drama of the Razzies' First 25 Years, but lost to Battlefield Earth. Zadora's performance in this film and Butterfly also led to her being nominated for three special Razzies: Two in 1990, for \"Worst New Star of the Decade\", which she won, and \"Worst Actress of the Decade\", where she lost against Bo Derek, and \"Worst Actress of the Century\" in 2000, where she lost against Madonna.

      "Produced by George Lucas and based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, Howard the Duck received overwhelmingly negative reviews from film critics. Orange Coast Magazine writer Marc Weinberg and Leonard Maltin criticized the decision to shoot the film in live action. Maltin described it as a \"hopeless mess ... a gargantuan production which produces a gargantuan headache\". The appearance of Howard was criticized as being unconvincing due to his poorly functioning mouth and expressionless face. Reviewers also criticized the acting and humor and found the film boring. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune said the movie's \"crude, often embarrassing, sex jokes\" seemed \"out of place\" with the more innocent aspects of the film. Jay Carr of The Boston Globe claimed that \"They Don't Get Much Worse Than Howard\", Glenn Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine wrote that it \"has a rightful place in the canon of worst films ever\", and TV Guide states it is \"one of the worst big-budget movies ever made\".Film website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 15% based on 48 reviews, making it the lowest-rated Lucasfilm production of those reviewed on the site. The site's consensus states: \"While it has its moments, Howard the Duck suffers from an uneven tone and mediocre performances.\" It received seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations in 1987 including Worst Supporting Actor (Tim Robbins), Worst Director (Willard Huyck) and Worst Original Song (\"Howard the Duck\"). It won four trophies for Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star (\"the six guys and gals in the duck suit\"), Worst Visual Effects, and Worst Picture, tied with Under the Cherry Moon. The movie also won a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. It was featured in Empire's poll of the 50 worst films ever made. The negative reaction to the film took its toll on the cast, who found themselves unable to work on other projects as a result. Over time, the movie has remained a source of fascination and developed \"a small, but loyal fanbase.\" Howard the Duck has appeared in several Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and series beginning in 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, in which he was voiced by Seth Green.\n",

Beatty and Hoffman star as Rogers and Clarke, two untalented lounge singers who travel to Morocco in hopes of finding a gig. Due to unanticipated problems with filming in the desert—which resulted in numerous reshoots—the film ran over budget by $30 million. While its final budget cost was $55 million, Ishtar earned only $14,375,181 at the North American box office leading Ishtar to become synonymous with \"box office flop\". It was also subject to harsh reviews from critics. The film was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay in the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Director.  The San Jose Mercury News claimed that \"Time has not improved this film's reputation as being one of the worst ever made.\" Time Out suggested it was \"so bad it could have been deliberate\", and called it \"one of the worst films ever made\", while Hot Air referred to it as \"The Citizen Kane of big-budget, A-list vehicular homicides.\" It was included in Michael Sauter's The Worst Movies of All Time book and Richard Roeper included it on his list of the 40 worst films he had seen. In 1999, Time placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.However, the film has since become a cult classic, and it has also seen a recent minor critical re-evaluation, with some critics, including Richard Brody, praising the film, and directors Quentin Tarantino, Edgar Wright and Martin Scorsese liking it. Defenders argue that the studio did not back May, resulting in a public relations disaster before it was released in theaters. Joe Queenan compared the film to another comedy film considered the worst, Gigli, and wrote that although it was considered one of the worst films ever made at the time of its release, it \"has several comic moments\" and does not get worse on subsequent viewings, unlike Gigli.

The film was heavily inspired by Steven Spielberg's 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Simon Abrams of Politico wrote that Nukie was worse than 1988 E.T. knock-off, Mac and Me, writing that it is \"probably the most incompetent E.T. ripoff of any time period ...

Despised by fans and critics alike, it is the lowest-grossing film in the series, only taking in $15,681,020 at the North American box office. Many critics pointed out the film's poor screenplay, acting, and special effects (such as a scene in which Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with his super-vision), while some have criticized it for its lack of attention to the comic book source material. Such special effects led Rita Kempley of The Washington Post to call it \"one of the cheesiest movies ever made\". Film critic Jeffrey Lyles voiced similar hatred, claiming that the film \"isn't just one of the worst comic book films, it's one of the worst films ever made\". Superman IV holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews. It appears on Empire's list of the 50 worst movies of all time, as well as the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.

The title characters are depicted by dwarf actors in low-budget costumes, with poorly functioning mouths and expressionless faces. The film is often criticized for its gross-out humor, nonsensical plot, poor explanations, bad acting, and the unsettling appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 1, making it tied for the lowest scoring film on the site. Caryn James of The New York Times said the movie is \"too repulsive for children or adults of any age\" and is \"enough to make you believe in strict and faraway boarding schools\". Carlos Coto of the Sun-Sentinel called it \"one of the worst ever made\". Much of its content is said to be inappropriate for children, its intended audience. Throughout the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids steal, get in fights, bite toes off people, flatulate in people's faces, threaten others with switchblades, urinate upon themselves, and run over cars. In addition to scatological behavior, the movie has several scenes that feature sexual images, violence, and drinking. Offended parents launched a nationwide protest of the movie that successfully resulted in the movie being withdrawn from circulation. The shortened release contributed to the movie's poor gross of only $1,576,615.

      "Caddyshack II, was a poorly-received sequel to the popular 1980 film Caddyshack. The script largely recycles concepts and jokes from the original: stars Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dan Aykroyd and Jonathan Silverman play roles which mirror those played by Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Bill Murray, and Michael O'Keefe in the original. According to writer Harold Ramis, the only original cast member initially interested in returning for the sequel was Dangerfield, who left early in production after a dispute with producers over his requested script rewrites and subsequently determining the film would not be successful. Eventually, Chevy Chase agreed to appear again in a small part; during post-production, he told director Allan Arkush to call him \"when you've dubbed the laugh track\" before leaving in disgust. Ramis, who co-wrote the original film alongside Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney, described Caddyshack II, which he co-wrote with Peter Torokvei, as \"terrible\". He went on to describe in a 1999 interview that he had strong misgivings about the film when it was pitched to him and only agreed because Dangerfield wanted him, and that after Dangerfield quit, he also quit and original director Alan Metter was fired in favor of Arkush. Dangerfield was sued by the film studio for refusing to appear, though the lawsuit did not change his mind and he was little affected by it.Sports Illustrated has referred to the film as one of the worst sequels in history, and as a \"stultifying dud\" with no interesting characters and \"groaner\" jokes with \"horse fart sound-effects\". The New York Times wrapped up their review with \"Caddyshack II is the kind of film that sends careers spiraling downward.\" Dave Kehr at the Chicago Tribune said \"It’s shoddy, lazy and numbingly stupid.\" Rita Kempley at the Washington Post said \"It’s patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet.\" Michael Wilmington at the Los Angeles Times wondered if there had ever been a worse sequel, stating that \"Even Rambo III has more laughs than Caddyshack II - And Sylvester Stallone wasn't even trying\".

You have no idea the torture it was to watch this movie several times in the space of a week. It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done.\" Specific points of the film that were lampooned were the extreme misogyny and atrocious treatment of women; the film's technical incompetence and repetitive scenes; its asinine, poorly conceived plot; its dreadful acting; and its ugly look and gratuitous vulgarity, particularly in regards to its characters and subject matter. David Cornelius of DVD Talk stated, \"There's not one aspect of this movie that isn't the Worst Thing Ever.\" After seeing the MST3K episode himself, Sloane was inspired to direct a sequel, which was released in 2009.\n",

A box office failure, the film grossed $6,424,112 in the United States on a $13 million budget. It used to have a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, whose critical consensus notes that it is \"duly infamous\" as both an imitation of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and a marketing vehicle for McDonald's and Coca-Cola (the filmmakers had admitted a profit-sharing arrangement with the former). One scene features a large, impromptu dance-off with the alien (dressed in a teddy bear costume), a football team, Ronald McDonald, and various other people inside and outside of a McDonald's restaurant. Leonard Maltin described the film as being \"more like a TV commercial than a movie\", and Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle called it a \"shameless E.T. knockoff\". Mac and Me is widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made, with The Telegraph reporting that it is \"frequently pulled out in 'worst film of all time' arguments\". Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (responsible for the 2004 Oscar-nominated Super Size Me) declared it the \"worst thing you'll ever see in your entire life\", as well as the most egregious example of product placement in cinema history. The film was also named the worst ever in the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as by broadcaster Simon Mayo and writer/producer Damon Lindelof. Michael Hayden of GQ India referred to it as \"hands down the worst family movie in Hollywood history\". The film was nominated for four Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and won two trophies: Worst Director for Stewart Raffill (tied with Blake Edwards for Sunset) and Worst New Star for Ronald McDonald in a cameo. Mac and Me has however gained a cult following and was featured on the second season of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival (the only Razzie-winning film ever to be riffed in the history of the show).\n",

      "Things, a Canadian low budget, independent, horror exploitation film, was written and produced by Andrew Jordan & Barry J. Gillis. It cost approximately $35,000 in total to make and marked the mainstream film debut of porn star Amber Lynn. It was ostensibly made as homage to horror icons and films, such as George A. Romero and his Night of the Living Dead. Cinema Sewer magazine has repeatedly proclaimed that \"this is the worst movie ever made\". Robin Bougie, its founder and editor, wrote \"I don't mean [\"bad\"] like the way Troma makes bad movies. I'm talking about bad with the best of intentions, like all of the best \"bad\" movies. You like tormenting yourself with hilariously trashy, moronic, gory, idiotic bad films? Things is the fucking king of bad movies. This is the movie you put on when you have a get together of pals — and just blow them away. Trust me, you have never seen anything like this in your life. It's absolutely astonishing in how it is able to mentally wreck anyone who watches it.\" Jeff Kirschner of Dread Central has also named it the worst movie ever made. Things was covered in an episode of RedLetterMedia show Half in the Bag; during the discussion Jay Bauman stated that Things was \"probably one of the worst movies ever made\", to which Mike Stoklasa replied \"I would remove 'probably'.\"\n",

And then there's Troll 2—a movie that's so bad that it defies comprehension.\" In addition, TV Guide proclaimed that \"Troll 2 is really as bad as they come.\" Nearly twenty years after its release, the movie's child star, Michael Stephenson, made a documentary about its production and fanbase titled Best Worst Movie, released to critical success in 2009. The bad acting and dialogue have become notorious for their camp value; the scene in which Darren Ewing's character states that he will be eaten next has become an Internet meme.\n",

      "\n",
      "The French-British film Highlander II: The Quickening is a sequel to the 1986 cult film Highlander, which transitions the fantasy of the original film into science fiction, and retcons the mystical warriors of the first film into aliens. It was met with harsh criticism by both critics and audiences. Based on 24 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 0% \"Rotten\" rating. Common criticisms included the lack of motivation for the characters, blatant disregard for backstory from the first film (such as the new and seemingly incongruent origin for the Immortals and the unexplained resurrection of Ramirez), glaring plot holes, a messy and nonsensical story structure, the filmmaker's inability to balance unrelated plots and subplots, and obvious contradictions in the film's internal logic. Roger Ebert named it the worst film of 1991, stating: \"If there is a planet somewhere whose civilization is based on the worst movies of all time, Highlander 2: The Quickening deserves a sacred place among their most treasured artifacts.\" An IGN review said: \"How bad is this movie? Well, imagine if Ed Wood were alive today, and someone gave him a multi-million dollar budget. See his imagination running rampant, bringing in aliens from outer space with immensely powerful firearms, immortals who bring each other back to life by calling out their names, epic duels on flying skateboards, and a blatant disregard for anything logical or previously established—now you are starting to get closer to the vision of Highlander II.\"In 1995, the film's director Russell Mulcahy made a director's cut version known as Highlander 2: Renegade Version and then later released another version simply known as Highlander 2: The Special Edition for its 2004 DVD release. The film was reconstructed on both occasions largely from existing material, with certain scenes removed and others added back in, and the entire sequence of events changed. The reconstructed film's reception was far better than the original's; it was elevated to a mixed reception.\n",

The production received bad publicity, as it was made using money from the country's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. Paolo Mereghetti in his film encyclopedia Dizionario dei Film described the film as a \"vapid mess that can only serve those incapable of understanding what cinema is\", and considered it able to \"compete for the title of worst film in cinema history and win!\" G. Giraud wrote in Il Lavoro that Cattive ragazze \"does not resemble anything in a real movie, or even recall anything previously seen at the cinema, even in its worst\". Film critic Marco Giusti refers to it as \"one of the pillars of Italian trash cinema\". While Cattive ragazze was Ripa Di Meana's directorial debut, she never made another film.\n",

North, which was also Scarlett Johansson's film debut, was a critical and commercial failure, earning only $7,138,449 worldwide despite its budget of over $40 million. It was widely criticized for its plot, its all-star cast of insensitive characters, lack of humor and portrayal of numerous ethnic stereotypes. It has a 14% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and, in his review, infamously wrote, \"I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\" He continued saying \"\"North\" is a bad film – one of the worst movies ever made\", and it is also on his list of most hated films. Both Ebert and Gene Siskel named North as the worst film of 1994. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said in his review that \"North is director Rob Reiner's first flat-out failure, a sincerely wrought, energetically made picture that all the same crashes on takeoff. It's strange and oddly distasteful, at its best managing to be bad in some original and unexpected ways.\" Richard Roeper named North as one of the 40 worst movies he has ever seen, saying that, \"Of all the films on this list, North may be the most difficult to watch from start to finish.\" The film was nominated for the following awards at the 15th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Bruce Willis, also for Color of Night), Worst Supporting Actress (Kathy Bates), Worst Supporting Actor (Dan Aykroyd, also for Exit to Eden), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay (Andrew Scheinman and Alan Zweibel).\n",

Critic Harald Kolstad of Dagsavisen gave it a score of zero, refused to acknowledge Dis as a film, and claimed to have never seen anything worse. Aftenposten referred to the film as \"the largest turkey\" and \"the most reviled film\", and Total Film included it on its list of the 66 worst films ever made.

Much hype revolved around the film's star, Elizabeth Berkley, who only two years before had starred in the lighthearted teen sitcom Saved by the Bell. The film won seven Razzie Awards, a record at that time, and received 13 nominations, a record that still stands. It received an additional award at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, where it was awarded Worst Picture of the Decade. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it, \"a film of thunderous oafishness that gives adult subject matter the kind of bad name it does not need or deserve\". Michael Dequina of TheMovieReport.com also criticized the film, claiming that it was \"the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer\". Adam White wrote in The Independent that it was \"the worst movie ever made\" but also a masterpiece. Stephen Lynch of the Knight Ridder/Tribune similarly named it the worst movie ever made, calling it \"so bad it may be brilliant\". Rotten Tomatoes selected it as one of 25 movies that are so bad they're unmissable while Empire featured it on its poll of the worst films ever made. Showgirls was also featured in Michael Sauter's The Worst Movies of All Time book as well as The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst. Despite being a critical failure and failing at the box office initially, Showgirls found success as a camp cult film, particularly among the LGBT community, but whether the film was intended to be satirical remains subject to debate. On the home video market, the film was MGM's most profitable release for years.\n",

The film was criticized as boring and humourless, and was also accused of being a vanity project for Moore. Daniel P. Franklin, discussing Striptease in his book Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States stated \"This is the worst film ever made.\" Joe Queenan cited Striptease as an example of what he considered the poor quality of contemporary Hollywood cinema: \"One thing that I admire about films like Striptease is that they serve as powerful reminders that on any given day, Hollywood has the potential to release the worst film in history.\" Richard Schickel, in Time, also criticized the film: \"Bergman ... misses Hiaasen's strength: setting mean-funny characters spinning through lowlife milieus ... the crazy, nothing-to-lose anarchy of people living below the margin and beyond the fringe is not within Bergman's fastidious reach.\" Leonard Maltin stated that Striptease was \"Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or bad enough, to qualify as entertainment in any category.\" Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's stated \"While Showgirls was honestly sleazy, Striptease is tacky, pretentious – and boring. Trying to be a comedy, a morality tale and a titillating sideshow, Striptease fails on all counts.\" Striptease was awarded six Golden Raspberry awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actress (Moore), Worst Original Song (\"(Pussy Pussy Pussy) Whose Kitty Cat Are You?\"), and Worst Screen Couple (Moore and Burt Reynolds).\n",

It follows a French author who fled to Mexico for a quiet life and an actress who is willing to seduce him to get a part in a film adapted from one of his books. Before its release, Le Jour et la Nuit was heavily promoted in many French newspapers and magazines. When the film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, hundreds of journalists walked out of the screening and those that stayed audibly ridiculed it. Following its release, Le Jour et la Nuit was very harshly criticized by the French media. Gérard Lefort of Libération described the film as \"BHL pedalling through guacamole\", and it was also panned by Le Monde and Le Nouvel Observateur. The film also did poorly commercially, with only 73,147 seats for Le Jour et la Nuit having been sold two months after its release. Le Jour et la Nuit was considered the worst French film since 1945 by film magazine Cahiers du cinéma, and considered as a possible \"worst film in history\" by the French version of Slate. Variety said the film was \"[l]augh-out-loud awful without touching the cult realm of 'so bad it's good'\", Françoise Giroud stated that \"[i]t's a bad movie, there's no question\", and L'Humanité called it an \"Absolute debacle\".

This film was largely criticized for its toyetic and camp approach, and Mr. Freeze's approach and one-line jokes. As of June 2017, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 11% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 89 reviews, certifying it \"Rotten\" with an average rating of 3.7/10, and the critics consensus: \"Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for.\" By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 28/100, based on 21 reviews. Michael J. Nelson, of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame, wrote of the movie in his book, Movie Megacheese, \"Batman & Robin is not the worst movie ever. No, indeed. It's the worst thing ever.

It was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. The Avengers began to receive negative publicity after Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers. After early test screenings, The Avengers was heavily edited by the studio. On its release, The Avengers was savaged by film critics, with the Birmingham Post stating \"The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made\" and adding that one reviewer had joked the film was such a \"turkey\" that the makers should have handed distribution to the poultry chain Bernard Matthews. Several reviewers disparaged The Avengers for lacking the wit and excitement of its source material. Janet Maslin strongly criticised The Avengers: \"With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of Howard the Duck that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of \"Ugh!\" on the way out the door\" and finished her review with, \"At a pared-down, barely rational 100 minutes, The Avengers is short but not short enough.\"David Bianculli said, \"This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name.\" Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated \"The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department ... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy.\" The Avengers also shared a Razzie Award for \"Worst Remake or Sequel\" with the 1998 adaptations of Psycho and Godzilla at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards.

Despite an all-star cast, including Alexandre Pires, Perez's then-boyfriend and a very popular singer in Brazil at the time, the movie was criticized for its campy dialogue, badly written script, numerous plot holes and ludicrous acting, to the point of Perez herself disowning the film years later. It was a box office bomb, and it was some time later banned from circulation by request of Perez herself. It was also the debut of a then-unknown Lázaro Ramos, who used his salary to pay for acting classes. On March 15, 2010, Brazilian magazine Veja made a Top 10 list of the worst Brazilian movies of all time, and Cinderela Baiana was featured in first place.

It was criticized for a poor script, hammy acting, overuse of Dutch angles, repetitive dialogue, and several inconsistencies and plot holes.

Fade In stated that \"Glitter isn't just one of the worst music-themed films ever — it's one of the worst films ever made, period.\" Author Bob McCann wrote in Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television that it's \"rightfully in the running as one of the worst films ever made\". News.com.au, Hi, Flavorwire, Metacritic, and Empire are amongst those who have listed it as one of the worst films ever made.Glitter received six Razzie nominations and Carey won for Worst Actress. It was also featured in John Wilson's The Official Razzie Movie Guide, and in 2005, it was nominated for \"Worst Musical of Our First 25 Years\", but lost to From Justin to Kelly. In an interview in 2010, Carey stated that she believed that the film's failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack being released the same day as the September 11 attacks. It has a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews.\n",

      "A remake of a 1974 Italian film of the same name, the romantic comedy film Swept Away was directed by Guy Ritchie and starred his then-wife Madonna and Adriano Giannini. It received mostly extremely negative reviews, with most of the criticism going towards Madonna's bad acting, the original film being considered superior and the remake being considered just a star vehicle for Madonna. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 5% rating, based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 2.76/10. The site's consensus states: \"Muddled and lacking the political context of the original, Swept Away offers further proof that Madonna can't act.\" Metacritic reports an 18 out of 100 rating, based on 27 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Rex Reed of The Observer said: \"If there is one thing worse than a Guy Ritchie movie, it's a Guy Ritchie movie with Madonna in it.\" Joe Queenan of The Guardian discussed the movie in an article on what makes a movie the worst of all time and said, \"[...] Showgirls has a certain campy allure that grows a bit each time I see it. Madonna's Swept Away doesn't; it seems more amateurish on each viewing, like a morass that starts out as a quagmire, then morphs into a cesspool and finally turns into a slime pit on the road to its ultimate destination in the bowels of Hell.\" Julie Burchill, also from The Guardian, selected it as her pick for the worst film ever made.John Anderson of Newsday said, \"New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.\" Swept Away was also a box office bomb; against a $10 million budget, it grossed $598,645 in the United States and around $437,875 from foreign territories for a worldwide total gross of $1,036,520. The film was awarded five awards at the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Madonna), Worst Screen Couple (Madonna and Giannini), Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Director (Ritchie), while also being nominated for Worst Actor (Giannini) and Worst Screenplay. It was the first film to win both Worst Picture and Worst Remake or Sequel. At the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years, and at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst Picture of the Decade, but in both cases lost to Battlefield Earth. Empire ranked it #20 in its list of \"The 50 Worst Movies Ever\", and After Ellen ranked it #7 in its list of \"The worst movies ever to grace the screen\".\n",

      "The comedy film The Master of Disguise was produced in part by Adam Sandler and stars Dana Carvey as Pistachio Disguisey, an undercover Italian waiter who must save his father Fabbrizio (James Brolin) from the evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) by using his inherent skills in disguise. Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its flatulence gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as Tony Montana from Scarface). Many critics also pointed out the short running time, consisting of 72 minutes of the film itself and over ten minutes of end credits juxtaposed with outtakes. Roger Ebert gave it one star out of four, claiming, \"The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.\" Alan Morrisson, writing for the film magazine Empire, proclaimed that The Master of Disguise was \"the worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots\", while Matthew Turner of ViewLondon remarked, \"This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.\" The film holds a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 104 reviews, and was featured on the site's list of the top 100 worst-reviewed films of the 2000s. It also appears on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. A cameo appearance by Bo Derek landed her a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards, but she lost to Madonna for Die Another Day.\n",

      "The action film Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as opposing secret agents. Critics panned it, generally regarding it as having no redeeming features, not even the unintentional comedic value normally associated with bad films. They variously described the film as \"A picture for idiots\", \"Boring to an amazing degree\", \"A fine achievement in stupidity and dullness\", \"Dreadful\", \"[Giving] new meaning to the word incoherent\", and \"bad on just about every level\". One critic suggested an alternative title as \"Simplistic: Bullets Vs. Humans\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote, \"You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense.\" Roger Ebert, who included the film in his \"most hated list\", called the movie \"a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence.\" In addition to being lambasted by critics, it was a disaster financially, recouping just over $19.9 million of its $70 million budget. In March 2007, the movie review site Rotten Tomatoes ranked it #1 among \"The Worst of the Worst\" movie list, with 108 \"rotten\" reviews and no \"fresh\" ones. Mental Floss also listed it as the worst movie ever made.\n",

      "A low-budget 2002 American romantic drama film about the titular gay couple who come into conflict with Arthur's religious brother, Ben and Arthur was written, directed, produced, edited, and scored by Sam Mraovich, who also played the character Arthur. Ben and Arthur received strong criticism (especially from the LGBT community) for its low budget and poor plotting. BuzzFeed described it as the \"worst gay movie of all time\". The gay popular culture site Queerty described Ben and Arthur as \"unintelligible\" and ended its review by calling it the \"Worst. Movie. Ever.\" The gay movie review site Cinemaqueer likewise stated: \"Ben and Arthur is so terrible that it has awoken the dormant Bette Davis in me. It is so painfully bad that it wouldn't even make good fodder on Mystery Science Theater 3000. This just might possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen ... Unless you get a kick out of mocking bad films, avoid this one at all costs.\" Michael Adams, reviewing the film for his book Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies, describes it thus: \"Ben & Arthur is as over-the-top insane as it is ludicrously executed ... the production values, from biscuits on plates comprising the main course of a candlelit dinner to a church literally having a cardboard cross and a cartoon Jesus on the wall, are as bad as anything I've seen.\" A Rotten Tomatoes article placed Ben and Arthur on their list of \"Films So Bad They're Unmissable\", saying \"If Tommy Wiseau's The Room is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich's Ben & Arthur is its gay equivalent.\" Rotten Tomatoes also stated \"Every scene, every line, every hissy fit is simultaneously hilariously amateur and hysterically fever-pitched.\" Total Film ranked Ben and Arthur at #58 in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Mraovich finds Ben and Arthur's placement among the canon of worst films to be a blessing as the film has received more attention than he ever anticipated.\n",

      "The romantic-comedy musical From Justin to Kelly stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the winner and runner-up, respectively, of the first season of American Idol. The film was a critical and commercial disaster, earning only $4.9 million at the North American box office and achieving a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews. Josh Tyrangiel of Time Magazine described From Justin to Kelly as \"a monstrous Idol movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century\", while The Free Lance–Star referred to it as \"the world's worst movie\". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club, reviewing the film for his \"My Year of Flops\" series, stated, \"All films require suspension of disbelief. From Justin To Kelly requires something more like a temporary lobotomy. Nothing about the main characters or their relationships makes sense.\" It won a special Razzie—\"Governor's Award – Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography\"—at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards. It was nominated for eight additional Razzies (including a second special award, \"Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie\"), and a year later it won for Worst \"Musical\" of Our First 25 Years. Total Film included From Justin to Kelly on their list of \"The 66 Worst Films of All Time\". In a later interview, Clarkson expressed regret over From Justin to Kelly, stating she only did it because she was contractually obligated to do so: \"I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.\"\n",

      "The independently produced The Room, about an amiable banker whose friends betray him one by one, has been called \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\" by some critics. The Guardian, Vox, The Washington Post, ABC Australia and Süddeutsche Zeitung called it the worst film ever made. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club called it \"the greatest bad movie of our time\" and said, \"The Room is nearly an anti-film—an inane and unintentionally surreal soap opera, filled with non sequiturs, confused characters, and gratuitous, anatomically incorrect sex.\" Though the film's star, writer, producer, and director Tommy Wiseau has claimed it is a black comedy and its numerous flaws are intentional, other actors involved in the production have denied this, saying that Wiseau intended it as a melodramatic romance.The Room has been noted for its bizarre and non-sequiturial dialogue, protracted sex scenes, various subplots that are inadequately resolved or simply disappear altogether (most notably, a character announces that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, but this is never mentioned again throughout the entire film), and infamous use of green-screen for \"outdoor\" rooftop scenes. It made its broadcast premiere as an April Fools' Day special in 2009 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, edited down from its original R rating to a TV-14/DSLV rating. The day after its appearance, its DVD became the top-selling independent film on Amazon.com. In June 2010, The Room started playing at the American Film Institute Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland. Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through their site RiffTrax.com. In 2013, the book The Disaster Artist, written by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, was published; the book is Sestero's memoir of his involvement in the production of the movie. The book was adapted into an Oscar-nominated film of the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Wiseau (winning a Best Actor Golden Globe Award for his performance) and his brother Dave Franco as Sestero.\n",

      "The Martin Brest movie Gigli features Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, with appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. Gigli was originally a black comedy with no romantic subplot, but the producers demanded script rewrites throughout filming, hoping to cash in on the Lopez-Affleck romance that was then big news in celebrity-watching publications such as Us and People. This film cost $54 million to make but grossed only $6 million, making it one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. The Times gave the film a zero, making Gigli the lowest scored film review in the publication's history at that time. The Wall Street Journal stated that it was \"[t]he worst movie—all right, the worst allegedly major movie—of our admittedly young century\", while Roger Friedman of Fox News claimed it was \"[t]he worst movie ever made\". It was also the winner of seven Razzies (including 2005's Worst \"Comedy\" of Our First 25 Years), and in 2010 the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Worst Picture of the Decade\". It is in Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s, where it has a 6% rating.

      "The 2004 British sex comedy Sex Lives of the Potato Men is about a group of potato delivery men. The film received strongly hostile reviews from the British media. Reviews claimed Sex Lives of the Potato Men was unfunny, disgusting, and depressing. Writing in the Daily Mirror, film critic Kevin O'Sullivan called Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"one of the worst films ever made\". Novelist Will Self, in his review for The Evening Standard, called Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"mirthless, worthless, toothless, useless\". The Times reviewer James Christopher dubbed Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"one of the two most nauseous films ever made ... a masterclass in film-making ineptitude\". The Sunday Express film critic, Henry Fitzherbert, also strongly condemned the film: \"Sex Lives is so awful it left me slack-jawed in disbelief ... it must be one of the worst British comedies.\" Catherine Shoard, in a critique in The Sunday Telegraph, stated \"It's hard to know what to say to this – it's like finding the right words at a nasty accident ... Sex Lives of the Potato Men is probably the lewdest Brit-com since Confessions of a Window Cleaner, and certainly the worst.\" Shoard also described the film as \"Less a film than an appetite suppressant.\" Alan Morrison in the Scottish Daily Record described it as \"puerile smut of the very worst kind ... Sex Lives of the Potato Men should never have been made\". The Irish Times later noted that \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men attracted some of the worst reviews in living memory.\" The Birmingham Post described Sex Lives of the Potato Men as \"quite possibly the worst film ever made\", while The Independent on Sunday stated that the film was \"a strong contender for the title of worst film of all time\".

      "Nominally based on the DC Comics character, Catwoman stars Halle Berry as the title character. It bears little to no resemblance to the Batman antagonist: the cinematic Catwoman has superpowers, unlike in the comics, and leaps from rooftop to rooftop in stiletto heels. The character's signature lycra catsuit was replaced with slashed leather trousers and matching bra, and a mask that also acts as a hat. She also has a different name, Patience Phillips, than the established DC Catwoman character, Selina Kyle. As the movie character differs so widely from her comic book source, the character, as portrayed in this film, has been cited as \"Catwoman in Name Only\". The film was the result of various rewrites by a total of 28 different screenwriters, though only four were credited after arbitration with the WGA. It has a 9% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was declared \"arguably the worst superhero film ever made\" by the Orlando Sentinel. Jean Lowerison of the San Diego Metropolitan said in her review that Catwoman \"goes on my 'worst' list for the year, and quite possibly for all time\". Sadaf Ahsan of the National Post went further, calling it the worst movie ever made. The Village Voice summed up reviews of the film under the title \"Me-Ouch\". The movie was the winner of four Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director (Pitof) and Worst Screenplay. Berry arrived at the ceremony to accept her Razzie in person (with her Best Actress Oscar for Monster's Ball in hand), saying: \"First of all, I want to thank Warner Bros. Thank you for putting me in a piece of shit, god-awful movie ... It was just what my career needed.\" It is also on Roger Ebert's \"most hated\" list.\n",

      "The German film Daniel – Der Zauberer was directed by Ulli Lommel and stars pop singer and ex-Deutschland sucht den Superstar contestant Daniel Küblböck, who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself. The title is misleading as it implies that Küblböck is \"Der Zauberer\" (\"The Wizard\"), while the sorcerer is actually a different character (played by Ulli Lommel, the writer/director of the film). The Daily Dot wrote that it is considered to be the worst German film, while n-tv said it was \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". The website filmstarts.de states that Daniel – Der Zauberer was \"unbearable for non-fans of Küblböck\", adding that \"the performances of the actors were some of the worst in the history of German cinema\", and alleging that Ulli Lommel and producer Peter Schamoni had \"damaged their reputation\".The film also performed extremely poorly at the box office, having only 13,834 viewers altogether, which led to it being withdrawn from screening at most cinemas within the first week, with RP Online referring to it as a \"super-flop\". It is consistently listed at IMDb's Bottom 100 list and became the lowest rated film at one point. Total Film listed it as the third worst film of all time, after Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 and the direct-to-video animated mockbuster Titanic: The Legend Goes On, and New York Daily News listed it among the seven worst films ever made. In an interview conducted several years after its release, Daniel Küblböck admitted that, in retrospect, \"[Y]ou have to say this is the worst movie of all time really\". Filmstarts.de ranked it #4 in its list of the 25 worst movies ever made, and on the German movie rating site Moviepilot.de, it is the lowest-rated film with an average rating of 0.4/10.\n",

It is a sequel to the 1999 film Baby Geniuses and like its predecessor, it received negative reviews from film critics, becoming the 6th worst reviewed film of the decade on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% rating. Following the plot of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk', and have knowledge of many secrets. The \"baby geniuses\" become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), a notorious kidnapper of children, who intends to use a satellite system to brainwash the world's population and force them to watch television for the rest of their lives. The film was a box office bomb, only receiving $9 million from its $20 million budget. Entertainment Weekly writer Joshua Rivera stated that it was the worst movie he had ever sat through, and Tom Long of The Deseret News said \"It is perhaps the most incompetent and least funny comic film ever made.\" It was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Director (Bob Clark), Worst Supporting Actor (Jon Voight) and Worst Screenplay (Steven Paul (story) & Gregory Poppen). Total Film named it the runner-up to Titanic: The Legend Goes On in its list of the worst films ever made, and Mental Floss selected it as the second worst movie ever made after Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever.

The movie has received a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was included in their Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s at number two. It appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list, and is one of the few films to have received an F rating on CinemaScore.  Roger Moore of The Orlando Sentinel stated: \"Alone in the Dark shows just how tenuous Plan 9 from Outer Space 's hold on that 'worst movie ever' title really is.\" Likewise, Peter Hartlaub, the San Francisco Chronicle's pop culture critic, called the film \"the best Ed Wood movie ever made ... a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality\". In 2009, he named it the worst film of the decade. Jeffrey Lyles of The Gazette considered it so bad that \"other legendary bad films ... await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies\", while Scott Nash of Three Movie Buffs dubbed it \"one of the worst movies ever made\". Screenwriter Blair Erickson wrote about his experience dealing with Boll and his original script, which was closer to the actual game itself, and Boll's script change demands on the comedy website Something Awful. It received two 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards nominations for Worst Director (Uwe Boll) and Worst Actress (Tara Reid), and won three 2005 Stinkers Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Special Effects.\n",

It offers the most uninspired, unfunny film pastiches imaginable, sometimes repeating entire sections of dialogue verbatim from the movies they're supposedly satirising. Nathan Rabin gave it an F score and said, \"Epic Movie [...] strays so far from the solid fundamentals of filmmaking that it calls the very foundation of humor into question.\" Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle said: \"I’ve rarely seen a movie as hostile as this one, both to its audience and to its protagonists, and I don't think I realized before just how mean-spirited comedy can get (and I was raised on the Three Stooges).\" Jamie Russell of the BBC called it \"the most excruciating, unfunny film you'll see this year... if not your entire lifetime.\" At the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, it received three nominations, for Worst Remake or Rip-off, Worst Screenplay and Worst Supporting Actress (Carmen Electra).

      "\n",
      "An independently produced film that is an apparent homage to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, Birdemic: Shock and Terror tells the story of a romance between the two leading characters, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, as their small town is attacked by birds (which do not appear until 47 minutes into the film). Written, directed, and produced by James Nguyen, it was intended as a \"romantic thriller\" but is notable due to its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting, bad dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and, in particular, its special effects, consisting primarily of poorly rendered computer generated eagles and vultures that perform physically awkward aerial maneuvers and explode upon impact with the ground. The film, which cost $10,000 to make, was called by the Huffington Post \"truly, one of the worst films ever made\" and by The Village Voice as \"one more in the pantheon of beloved trash-terpieces\". Flavorwire ranked it #1 in its list of the 50 worst films ever made. Slate deemed it among the worst movies ever made, while Salon referred to it as \"a cult hit among bad-movie fans\" and Variety stated that the film displayed \"all the revered hallmarks of hilariously bad filmmaking\". Following the home media release of Birdemic, Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through Rifftrax. They later riffed upon the film again theatrically. In response to the cult status of the first film, a sequel—Birdemic 2: The Resurrection—was released in 2013, and included many returning members of the cast and crew.\n",

      "The Last Airbender is a fantasy/adventure film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and is based on the acclaimed Nicktoons animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Upon release, the film received extremely negative reviews, with critics panning the bad acting, numerous plot holes, screenplay, poor special effects (despite its reported $150 million budget), and especially Shyamalan's directing. It was also ridiculed for the poor quality of its post-converted 3-D, and the casting of white and Indian actors to portray characters who were East Asian or Inuit in the source material triggered accusations of racism and whitewashing. Further criticism came from fans of the original cartoon series, who said the film differed tremendously from its critically acclaimed source material. David Onda of Comcast wrote that it \"has been called one of the worst ever made. The movie was universally panned by critics and failed to make back its production budget domestically.\" It garnered nine nominations at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five, including Worst Picture and Worst Director. Roger Ebert wrote, \"The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.\" When asked if Last Airbender had been the worst film he has ever seen, Mike Ryan of Vanity Fair answered, \"Yes\". Hi highlighted the film in their \"Worst Films Ever\" series, and Screen Rant and Digital Trends included it in their worst film lists. Dev Patel would later express regret and dislike for his role and his experience with the film. He described his performance as Prince Zuko as being as though he “saw a stranger on the screen that I couldn't relate to.”\n",

On Rotten Tomatoes, Bucky Larson has a 3% rating, based on 36 reviews.

Salon stated that Jack and Jill \"received some of the worst reviews of any movie ever\" upon its release. In the film, Jill is wooed by Al Pacino, whom Jack wants to be in his Dunkin' Donuts commercial. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times noted the irony of Pacino's presence, as the actor is best known for playing Michael Corleone in The Godfather, which is widely considered one of the best films ever made, in this film, which he called \"one of the worst movies in the history of cinema!\" Ramin Setoodeh of The Daily Beast and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone reviewed it together in an article entitled \"Adam Sandler's 'Jack and Jill' Is the Worst Movie Ever Made\". After an hour-long critique, RedLetterMedia claimed that it was \"so egregious that it ceased to be a film\", and the site also later called it \"the worst thing in the world\". Mike McGranaghan wrote, on his website The Aisle Seat: \"Howard the Duck, Gigli, Showgirls, From Justin to Kelly. What do they all have in common?

Years later, Donny (played by Sandler) crashes his now-adult son's (Andy Samberg) wedding and bachelor party to get his money so he can pay his taxes, therefore avoiding prison. The film has been widely panned due to its comedic portrayal of incest, hebephilia, statutory rape, and gerontophilia, with film critic Andrew O'Hehir of Salon stating, \"[Sandler's] new movie about a rape survivor and his estranged son is supposed to be funny, but radiates pain and rage.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times proclaimed, \"To say That's My Boy is one of the worst movies of the year is to insult 2012. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen\", while Richard Haridly of Quickflix called it \"one of the saddest and most exhausting\" films he has ever seen. MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher outright panned the film for its inability to generate laughs as well as its depraved content, calling it \"a disgusting excuse for a comedy\" and possibly \"the most repulsive movie I've ever seen\", and Jonathan Lack of We Got This Covered declared, \"That's My Boy isn't just the worst film of 2012, it's one of the most morally reprehensible comedies of all time, a disgusting movie you should stay far, far away from.\" Furthermore, Ed Whitfield of The Ooh Tray stated, \"It may be the worst film, in any genre, ever made\". In addition to the movie's overwhelmingly negative reviews, That's My Boy earned eight nominations at the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards, such as Worst Picture and Worst Director, and won the awards for Worst Actor (Sandler) and Worst Screenplay.

      "A British comedy film based on the stage farce of the same name, Run for Your Wife starred Danny Dyer as John Smith, a bigamist, and Denise van Outen and Sarah Harding as his wives. Run for Your Wife was directed by the author of the play, Ray Cooney (who also makes an uncredited cameo appearance). Upon release, Run for Your Wife was savaged by film critics, with the South African newspaper Daily News saying \"Run for Your Wife could be the worst film in history\", the Studio Briefing website reporting that \"Some writers are making the case that the British comedy may be 'the worst film ever'\", and The Daily Mirror claiming Run For Your Wife \"was branded the worst British film ever\". Run for Your Wife met with such overwhelmingly negative reviews upon release that the reviews themselves were widely reported in the UK media. The film was variously described as \"a catastrophe\", \"as funny as leprosy\" and \"30 years past its sell-by-date\", with The Guardian reviewer Peter Bradshaw saying that it \"makes The Dick Emery Show look edgy and contemporary\". The Independent's Anthony Quinn wrote, \"The stage play ran for nine years – it [the film] will be lucky to run for nine days. Perhaps never in the field of light entertainment have so many actors sacrificed so much dignity in the cause of so few jokes ... From the look of it, Cooney hasn't been in a cinema for about 30 years\".The cast featured numerous British celebrities in cameo roles, which was commented upon by several reviewers. The Metro commented that \"no one emerges unscathed among the cameo-packed cast that reads largely like a roll-call for Brit TV legends you'd previously suspected deceased\". The Daily Record described the film as \"an exasperating farce containing not one single, solitary laugh. Comprised of people losing their trousers and falling over, the film looks like a pilot for a (mercifully) never-commissioned 70s sitcom\". An article in the Independent described Run for Your Wife (along with the similarly panned Movie 43) as contenders for the title of the \"worst film in history\". The Berkhamsted & Tring Gazette reported \"critics have being queuing up to batter recent release Run for Your Wife, with general agreement that it ranks among the worst British comedies of all time\". Run for Your Wife was also a box office bomb, earning only £602 in its opening weekend at the British box office to its £900,000 budget. Run for Your Wife has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of July 29, 2015 based on 15 reviews.\n",

Several critics have called it one of the worst films ever made, including Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, who said \"There's just one use for Movie 43, apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later. It provides me with a handy new answer to a question I'm often asked: 'What's the worst film you've ever seen?'\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News also considered it the worst movie she ever saw. Brady Murphy of Murphy Reviews wrote, \"A world where a film like this can exist only reminds me of the other contemptible acts performed by human kind since the dawn of time, and is rather eye-opening in that respect. That probably wasn't intentional, though\"; he went on to say that \"The idea that anyone could think that this would be in any way humorous is simply unbelievable.\" He concluded his review by saying the movie \"had no heart\", and gave it the site's first zero out of ten rating. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times voiced similar hatred, calling it \"aggressively tasteless\" and \"the Citizen Kane of awful\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post stated, \"If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous Howard the Duck, Gigli, Ishtar and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing Movie 43.\" Movie 43 is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. It holds a 5% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews, averaging out at a 2.23/10 rating.

Writing for Film Threat, reviewer Mike Hodges described it as \"the worst movie ever made\", comparing it unfavorably to Troll 2 and The Room. Nathan Rabin, writing for Rotten Tomatoes, said Fateful Findings threatens The Room's position as \"best worst movie\", while reviewers of the podcast The Flop House said \"Move over The Room, move over Birdemic\" and Mystery Science Theater 3000 head writer Elliott Kalan described it as the \"good-est bad movie, maybe, I've ever seen\".\n",

It's disturbing to see such an atrocious, regressive, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic cinematic product force-fed to paying audiences. I can understand that a comedy need not be 'safe', but what goes on in Humshakals is simply too horrifying to bear.\" Saurabh Dwivedi of India Today stated \"I can only say that Humshakals will be listed in one of the worst films of the century.\" Writing in Emirates 24/7, Sneha May Francis said that it succeeded Khan's previous endeavor, Himmatwala, in becoming the worst Bollywood film ever. Fadnavis went further, writing that it displaced Himmatwala as the \"worst possible product any film industry in the world can offer\". Itrath Syed of The Georgia Straight stated that Humshakals was \"the absolute bottom of the cinematic barrel\". The film received five Golden Kela Award nominations, and won the “award” for Worst Film.

Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times said: \"This may be one of the least artful holiday films ever made.\" In response to the criticism, Cameron asked fans to give the film positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. This resulted in a backlash in which Internet users traveled to the Rotten Tomatoes page and condemned the film. Three weeks after its release, Saving Christmas became the lowest-rated film on IMDb's bottom 100 list.

United Passions' release in the U.S. occurred simultaneously with the 2015 FIFA corruption case, in which several current and former members of FIFA's executive committee were arrested on charges of corruption, and Blatter himself resigned following repeated accusations of corruption at FIFA under his leadership. United Passions was accused of ignoring these long-running claims. London Evening Standard's Des Kelly wrote that United Passions was \"the worst movie ever made\" and \"the most extraordinary vanity exercise; a vile, self-aggrandizing, sugar-coated pile of manure\". Sean Mahoney of Inquisitr called it the \"worst movie ever\". Daniel Gold of The New York Times claimed United Passions is \"one of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that's no good even for laughs\", later stating it would make the top three of his list of all time bad films. Several critics noted the irony of the film's depiction of Blatter as an anti-corruption campaigner. Paul Field of the Daily Mirror said that this created \"unintentional comedy gold\", while Sara Stewart of the New York Post described it as \"hilariously ill-timed\". On Rotten Tomatoes, United Passions has an approval rating of 0% based on 16 reviews, while on Metacritic, the film holds a score of 1 out of 100, based on 9 critics, and is tied for the lowest scoring film on the site.United Passions was also a box office bomb, becoming the lowest-grossing film ever in American history with a total take of $918, which surpassed the previous record held by I Kissed a Vampire ($1,380) in 2012. The film additionally went directly to DVD in France and was not distributed in a number of other European countries. Several of the people involved in United Passions later expressed regret over the film. Director Auburtin called United Passions \"a disaster\" and added: \"Now I'm seen as bad as the guy who brought AIDS to Africa or the guy who caused the financial crisis ... apparently I am a propaganda guy making films for corrupt people.\" Tim Roth apologized for taking part in the film and admitted that he took the job in United Passions for the money.

It was also a box-office success at Polish cinemas, grossing an estimated $8,964,000. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, who heavily criticized its softcore themes, sexual violence and Mafia glorification. Rotten Tomatoes collected 16 reviews and identified 0% of them as positive, with an average rating of 1.9/10.  Polish English-language news website The First News says that it has been dubbed one of the worst films ever. Taylor Andrews of Cosmopolitan called it the worst thing he had ever seen.

Maddy Mussen of The Tab called it \"the worst thing Netflix has ever produced\" and said \"If you have watched 365 Days on Netflix, there will not be a doubt in your mind that it’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen.\" Jessica Kiang of Variety called it \"a thoroughly terrible, politically objectionable, occasionally hilarious Polish humpathon\".In March 2021, the film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor (Michele Morrone), Worst Actress (Anna-Maria Sieklucka), Worst Screenplay and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, becoming the second foreign-language film to be nominated for Worst Picture after Italy's Pinocchio (2002; albeit the dubbed version), and won only one for Worst Screenplay.\n",

      "All Good Things is a 2010 American mystery/crime romantic drama film directed by Andrew Jarecki and written by Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling. Inspired by the life of convicted murderer Robert Durst, it stars Ryan Gosling,  Kirsten Dunst, and Frank Langella. Gosling portrays the wealthy son of a New York real estate tycoon (Langella) who develops a volatile relationship with his wife (Dunst) and becomes suspected of a series of murders, as well as his wife's unsolved disappearance.\n",
      "All Good Things was filmed between April and July 2008 in Connecticut and New York. Originally scheduled for a July 24, 2009 release, the film ultimately received a limited release on December 3, 2010.Durst professed admiration for the film, and after previously not cooperating with journalists, offered to be interviewed by Jarecki. Durst would ultimately sit with Jarecki for more than 20 hours over a multi-year period, which led to the six-part documentary miniseries The Jinx in 2015.\n",

      "== Plot ==\n",
      "In 1970s New York City, David Marks, the son of a powerful real estate tycoon Sanford Marks, marries Katie McCarthy, a working-class student. Together they flee New York for country life in Vermont, setting up a health food store called All Good Things, only to be lured back by Sanford, who preys upon David's insecurities by telling him that Katie deserves more than he's currently giving her. Upon their return, Katie and David buy a beautiful apartment and Katie brings up the idea of having children. David implies he can't have any. After buying a lake house out of town, Katie confesses to their pregnant neighbor that she is expecting as well. When Katie tells David the good news, he responds by throwing things and then breaks down at the thought of being a parent. After forcing Katie to make an appointment for an abortion, David misses the appointment while doing work for Sanford.\n",
      "Katie goes back to college and eventually gets into medical school while her relationship with David continues to deteriorate. Katie makes inquiries about a separation, but her funds, which she needs in order to pay for school, are cut off when she attempts to leave. Having been advised that she will need leverage to make the family let her go, Katie attempts to find incriminating documents of the family's financial activities. She then disappears without a trace, despite a $15,000 reward offered for any information on her whereabouts.\n",
      "Years later, the case is re-opened by the current District Attorney of New York after reading an unpublished novel written by David's best friend Deborah Lehrman, which contains a murder almost identical to the Marks case. Soon after this is announced, Lehrman is shot and killed in her home, and David is under suspicion again while standing trial for the murder of his neighbor Malvern Bump in Galveston, Texas. David is acquitted of the murder of Bump; the film states that nobody has ever been tried for Deborah Lehrman's murder and that Katie Marks remains a missing person to this day. A flashback implies that David left his wife's remains in the trunk of her car, which the father finds. The film ends with David visiting his dying father and whispering to him that he misses Katie every single day.\n",

      "The screenplay for All Good Things was written by Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling as a narrative loosely based on the events in the life of Robert Durst, a New York City real estate heir whose first wife, Kathleen McCormack, disappeared in 1982. The film's title refers to a health food store of the same name which Durst and McCormack had established in the 1970s.After the script was completed and Andrew Jarecki had agreed to direct, Ryan Gosling was attached to star and Kirsten Dunst was in negotiations by late January 2008. By early April, Frank Langella was in final negotiations with the film's producers to join.  Soon after, The Weinstein Company closed a deal to distribute All Good Things, and the film's budget was set at US$20 million.Filming began in April in New York City and various locations in Connecticut, which were chosen for \"the tax incentive, scenic and period locations\" provided by the state. Shooting on Lillinonah Drive at a lakefront house in Brookfield, Connecticut began in early May. Five locations at the Fairfield University campus were used for several scenes over a week of filming. The set moved to Carl Schurz Park, New York City, briefly before switching back to Connecticut. Three scenes were shot at Canal Street, Shelton, Connecticut, on May 30–31. Much of the Canal Street filming focused on the \"heavy, industrial features\" of the area, although the crew made some edits, such as graffiti removal.A single minute-long scene was shot on a bridge over the Housatonic River. Scenes were shot on Route 7 in Gaylordsville, Connecticut, on June 3, where a shop opposite the local fire department was used as a health food store. The following day, filming moved to Waterbury, Connecticut. The Hospital of Saint Raphael was used as a filming location on June 6. The film set at the hospital was built on a vacant floor scheduled to be renovated, and took a week for set designers to prepare. Filming later returned to Brookfield, Connecticut. The crew also shot for two days at the Ridgefield Community Center—standing in for New York's Gracie Mansion—in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Manhattan;s West 38th Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, was used for the old 42nd Street for shooting on June 25–26;  shops were converted into 1970s Times Square sex shops and strip shows.Jarecki, who previously produced and directed the 2003 documentary Capturing the Friedmans, said that making All Good Things \"was less about wanting to do a narrative feature vs. a documentary and more about the merits of this particular project\". He shot \"hundreds of hours of footage\" of  people associated with the true story of Robert Durst, saying that \"It was part of the process. Maybe it will end up on the DVD some day.\"He eventually used some of that footage in the HBO documentary miniseries The Jinx (2015). This included the result of hours of discussion with Durst himself.\n",

      "== Release ==\n",
      "The film was originally set for release on July 24, 2009. In spring 2009, the film was delayed. An insider from The Weinstein Company stated that \"the movie is really strong. We just needed more time to complete it.\" Soon after, the film was set to release on December 11, 2009, only to be delayed again. The Weinstein Company released their upcoming film slate, with All Good Things listed for a March 2010 release. This never materialized.In March 2010, director Andrew Jarecki bought back the U.S. distribution rights and was searching for a new distributor for the film. The Weinstein Company still holds the international rights, as well as basic cable television rights. On August 24, 2010, Magnolia Pictures acquired the American rights to the film and gave the film a theatrical release on December 3, 2010.All Good Things was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, with commentary by Jarecki and Robert Durst.\n",

      "=== Critical reception ===\n",
      "As of June 2020, the film holds a 35% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 98 reviews with an average rating of 5.51 out of 10. The consensus was: \"It's well-acted, and the true story that inspired it offers plenty of drama—which is why it's so frustrating that All Good Things is so clichéd and frustratingly ambiguous.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Both Kirsten Dunst and Ryan Gosling were praised for their performances. Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, applauded Dunst's performance, but added, \"I don't understand David Marks after seeing this film, and I don't know if Andrew Jarecki does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Box office ===\n",
      "All Good Things earned $582,024 at the US box office and another $62,511 at the foreign box office for a worldwide total of $644,535.\n",

      "== The Jinx ==\n",
      "Robert Durst professed admiration for All Good Things and telephoned Jarecki after its release, offering to be interviewed, although he had not previously cooperated with journalists. Durst and Jarecki spent more than 20 hours together over several years. In February and March, 2015, director Jarecki's six-part documentary miniseries, The Jinx, was shown on HBO. Durst was arrested in New Orleans, Louisiana, on first degree murder charges the day before the final episode aired on March 15, in which he appeared unintentionally to confess to three murders.\n",

      "An Internet celebrity (also known as a social media influencer, social media personality, internet personality, or simply influencer) is a celebrity who has acquired or developed their fame and notability through the Internet. The rise of social media has helped people increase their outreach to a global audience. Today, popular influencers are found on popular online platforms such as Twitch, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, VSCO, Reddit, WeChat, QQ, and TikTok.Internet celebrities often function as lifestyle gurus who promote a particular lifestyle or attitude. In this role, they are crucial influencers or multipliers for trends in genres including fashion, beauty, cooking, technology, video games, Esports, politics, music, sports, and entertainment. Internet celebrities may be recruited by companies for influencer marketing to advertise products to their fans and followers on their platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "In 1991 with the wide public availability of the Internet and the World Wide Web, numerous websites were created to serve as forums for topics of shared interest. In some topic areas, this allowed users to get advice and help from experienced users in that field, which helped gain the type of information that was typically lacking in mainstream print media or corporate websites. Dedicated social media sites arose from these, where users could create profiles and make friends with other users; the first such social media site was SixDegrees.com in 1997. Similarly, websites that supported blogging arose around 1997, and gave a means for users to post long-form articles and stories of their own. Since then, forums, social media, and blogging have become a central part of communication, social life, businesses, and news publishing. Popular social media platforms include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, WeChat, and WhatsApp. Within the last decade, studies show that Instagram (an app holding over 1 billion users) holds a majority of the influencer population. Sometimes, influencers are known as 'Instagrammers' or 'Instafamous'. \n",
      "There is a lot of debate revolving around the idea of whether social media influencers can actually be coined as celebrities, as their rises to fame are often less traditional and some may argue, easier. Melody Nouri talks about the differences between the two types in her article: \"The Power of Influence: Traditional Celebrities VS Social Media Influencer\". She also mentions the differences of the social impact these online influencers have. Nouri believes it is more damaging for young impressionable audiences on social media platforms, more than on previous media from the past: such as magazines, billboards, adverts and tabloids that feature celebrities. It is deemed easier to manipulate a certain image and lifestyle online, that viewers are prone to believe in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Influencers and marketing networks ===\n",
      "The attractiveness of celebrities to everyday society creates a sense of trust and confidence which consumers translate into the credibility of the products being promoted. A 2001 study from Rutgers University had found that people were using \"internet forums as influential sources of consumer information\". This study suggested that consumers were using Internet forums and social media to make purchasing decisions over traditional advertising and print sources. The more personable an influencer is with their audience by engaging with them, the more encouraging they would be to purchase a product.\n",
      "Companies nowadays are more concerned with feedback and comments they receive from their social media platforms, because consumers believe other consumers. Many rely on reviews to convince them to buy something. One bad review can cost a business a lot of revenue. A typical method of marketing between the influencer and the audience is \"B2C marketing\". B2C marketing, meaning Business to Consumer marketing, entails the strategies in which a business would undertake in order to promote themselves and their services directly to their target audiences. This is typically through the advertising and creating content through the influencer themselves. The intention is that their followers who relate or look up to certain influencers will be more inclined to purchase an item because their favorite 'Internet celebrity' recommended it. Internet celebrities typically promote a lifestyle of beauty and luxury fashion and foster consumer–brand relationships, while selling their own lines of merchandise. The early 2000s saw corporate attempts to use the Internet for influencing where some companies engaged with forums for promotion or to offer bloggers free products in exchange for positive reviews. Some of these practices were considered unethical.The Blogstar Network, launched in 2004 by Ted Murphy of MindComet, invited bloggers to an email list to receive paid offers from corporations based on the type of posts they made. An example of this includes being paid a few dollars for reviewing a fast-food meal in their blog.\n",
      "Blogstar is considered the first influencer marketing network. Murphy followed Blogstar with PayPerPost, launched in 2006, which paid influential posters at the larger forum and social media sides for each post about a corporate product. The payment rates were based on the influencer status of the individual. The very popular, PayPerPost, received a great deal of criticism as these influencers were not required to disclose their involvement with PayPerPost as traditional journalism would have, and made the public aware that there was a drive by corporate interests to influence what some people were posting to these sites. This site encouraged other companies to begin to create similar programs. Despite concerns, influencing marketing networks continued to grow through the rest of the 2000s and into the 2010s. The influencer marketing industry is on track to be worth up to $15 billion by 2022, up from as much as $8 billion in 2019, according to Business Insider Intelligence estimates, based on Mediakix data.An article written by David Rowles titled: 'Digital Branding: A Complete Step-By-Step Guide to Strategy, Tactics, Tools and Measurements,' details as to how and what techniques these internet celebrities use to get more recognition on their platforms from users and brands. \"Digital branding is the sum of experiences that we have online and it relies on the provision of value.\" It suggests that users are already exposed to the lives of their influencers as loyal fans, its easy for them to market companies as their fans feel as though they know the celebrities they follow, when the reality differs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Self-branding ===\n",
      "Self-branding, also known as personal branding, describes the development of a public image for commercial gain or social or cultural capital. The rise of social media has been exploited by individuals seeking personal fame and product sales. Platforms such as Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, VSCO, and TikTok, are the most common social media outlets on which online influencers attempt to build a following. Fame can be attained through different avenues and media forms, including art, humor, modeling, and podcasts. Marketing experts have concluded that \"[people no longer] need to be familiar with complex coding languages or other technicalities to build websites because virtually anyone can upload text, pictures, and video instantly to a site from a personal computer or phone. With technological barriers crumbling, the web has become the perfect platform for personal branding\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Types ==\n",
      "Depending on their rise to fame, Internet celebrities may reach their audiences in different ways. Millions of people write online journals or blogs, but most fail to become Internet celebrities. This is due to the volume of online creators. Due to certain social media platforms' algorithms, it is difficult for smaller bloggers to get more online coverage. In many cases, content does not reach a large audience and maybe intended for a smaller, niche audience. If a creator has or develops a distinctive personality, it may bring them more notoriety than their content does.In some cases, people might rise to fame through a single viral event or viral video. The Internet allows videos, news articles, and jokes to circulate rapidly. Depending on its reach, the content may become an Internet meme. For example, Zach Anner, a comedian from Austin, Texas, gained worldwide attention after submitting a video to Oprah Winfrey's \"Search for the Next TV Star\" competition. This is also commonly seen from a variety of other talk show hosts such as, Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, or James Corden, who feature viral individuals on their shows. Viral videos from internet celebrities could entail a funny event happening in the moment, a popular new dance, or even a post on twitter, such as the \"Alex from Target\" tweet in 2014. A young girl posted a photo of a Target employee who she thought was attractive, which went viral immediately and grew his following from 144 followers to 600,000. He was then interviewed on multiple talk shows and recognized in public by fans. People can also become Internet celebrities through popular meme posting, whether they are the memes themselves or they are creating content. It can be deemed as a reaction image, video, or a GIF. The meme can convey a message of feelings and emotions where an individual may have the desire of sharing on the Internet.\n",
      "The Internet celebrity concept echoes Andy Warhol's famous quote about 15 minutes of fame. A more recent adaptation of Warhol's quote—possibly prompted by the rise of online social networking, blogging, and similar online phenomena—is the claim that \"In the future, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\" or, in some renditions, \"On the Web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people.\" This quote, though attributed to David Weinberger, was said to have originated from the Scottish artist Momus.Internet celebrities, or influencers, can be broken into five different sizes: Nano, Micro, Macro, Mega, and Celebrity. Nano influencers generally have under 5,000 followers on Instagram. Micro influencers have between 5,000 and 100,000 followers on Instagram. Micro influencers are often seen as more trustworthy and relatable, making it easier for followers to perceive an interpersonal connection with them than with Mega Influencers. Macro influencers have between 100,000 and 500,000 followers on Instagram. Mega influencers have between 500,000 to 5,000,000 followers on Instagram. And finally, Celebrities are defined as having over 5,000,000 followers on Instagram. Given that influencers make a living from being celebrities popularized on the Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== YouTubers and vloggers ===\n",
      "\n",
      "YouTube has risen as one of the biggest platforms for launching Internet celebrities. Individual users can record videos of their daily lives and upload them online through YouTube. This activity is known as video blogging, or more commonly vlogging. YouTube creators (known as YouTubers), regardless of the genres or types of videos they make, have created an industry that can generate revenue from video views and online popularity. For example, Swedish Internet celebrity PewDiePie uploads gaming and comedy videos on YouTube. As of September 2019, he has around 100 million subscribers and is the most-subscribed non-corporation YouTuber.\n",
      "Every minute, 300 hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube, and 5 billion videos are watched every day. Individuals can create videos and upload them onto YouTube and other platforms in return for income. In August 2014, Variety wrote that YouTubers are more popular than mainstream celebrities among U.S. teens. Advertisers, in an effort to reach teenagers and millennials who do not watch regular television and movies, have started contacting YouTubers and other Internet celebrities. As of 2017, YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly active users, and many YouTubers have millions of subscribers.YouTubers appear to have a greater influence on Millennials than traditional celebrities. One of the main reasons is that the majority of millennials do not watch TV, but instead prefer to use platforms they can access from their mobile devices. 70% of YouTube users have said that YouTubers change and shape pop culture, and 60% of them have said they would make buying decisions based on the recommendations of their favorite YouTuber over those of a TV or movie star.YouTubers can make money directly through their YouTube channels by using ads or sponsoring products. YouTube's AdSense program allows YouTubers to earn revenue from ads and views. AdSense has certain requirements—a YouTuber must have more than 1,000 subscribers, live in an eligible country, and have more than 4,000 hours of watch time within a year to be eligible. YouTube can be a lucrative platform for Internet celebrities like PewDiePie, who made US$15.5 million in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Micro-celebrities ===\n",
      "A micro-celebrity, also known as a micro-influencer, is a person famous within a niche group of users on a social media platform. Micro-celebrities often present themselves as public figures. The concept of the micro-celebrity was originally developed by Theresa Senft in her 2008 book, Camgirls: Celebrity and Community in the Age of Social Networks. According to Senft, the concept of the micro-celebrity \"is best understood as a new style of online performance that involves people 'amping up' their popularity over the Web using technologies like video, blogs and social networking sites\". A number of other researchers have published papers on micro-celebrities. According to Raun, a micro-celebrity is \"a form of identity linked almost exclusively to the Internet, characterizing a process by which people express, create and share their identities online\". According to Senft and Marwick, micro-celebrities differ from more traditional forms of celebrities associated with Hollywood stars because a micro-celebrity's popularity is often directly linked to their audience, and the audience comes to expect a certain degree of authenticity and transparency.\n",
      "The Internet allows the masses to wrest control of fame from traditional media, creating micro-celebrities with the click of a mouse\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Wanghong ===\n",
      "Wanghong (Chinese: 网红; pinyin: wǎnghóng; lit. 'Internet fame') is the Chinese version of Internet stardom. The Wanghong economy is a Chinese digital economy based on influencer marketing in social media. Wanghong have been predominantly used to generate profits via retail or e-commerce, through attracting the attention of celebrities' followers. Internet celebrities have also become a popular phenomenon in China. For example, Sister Furong (Furong Jiejie) received worldwide notoriety and fame for her self-promotion efforts through online posts. According to CBN Data, a commercial data company affiliated with Alibaba Group, the Internet celebrities economy was estimated to be worth CN¥58 billion (US$8.4 billion) in 2016, which was more than China's total cinema box office revenue in 2015.There are two main business models in the Wanghong economy: Social Media Advertising, and Online retail. In the online retailing business model, e-commerce-based Wanghong involves the use of social media platforms to sell self-branded products to potential buyers among followers via Chinese customer-to-customer (C2C) websites, such as Taobao. Internet celebrities work as the models of their shops by posting pictures or videos of themselves, wearing the clothes or accessories they sell, or giving distinctive makeup or fashion tips. They serve as key opinion leaders for their followers, who either aspire to be like them or look up to them.\n",
      "Zhang Dayi—one of China's best-known Wanghong according to BBC News, with 4.9 million followers on Sina Weibo—has an online shop on Taobao, reportedly earning CN¥300 million (US$46 million) per year. This is comparable to the US$21 million made by Fan Bingbing, a top Chinese actress. Li Ziqi, a celebrity food blogger with more than 16 million followers on Weibo, has inspired many bloggers to post similar content on traditional Chinese cooking and crafts.Censorship in China has created an entirely independent social media ecosystem that has become successful in its own way. For every Western social media platform, there is a Chinese version that can be equally successful. Chinese social media platforms can be used differently from those in the West, but the results are the same—the platforms generate revenue. The greatest difference between Chinese Internet celebrities and their Western counterparts is that the profits generated by Chinese celebrities can be immense. Unlike YouTube, which takes 45% of advertising revenue, Weibo, one of the largest Chinese social media platforms, is not involved in advertising, which allows Internet celebrities to be more independent. The monthly income of Chinese influencers can exceed CN¥10 million (US$1.5 million).\n",

      "\n",
      "In Japan, a specific type of Internet celebrity is known as a net idol (ネットアイドル, Netto aidoru), a sub-category of the idol industry in Japan. Net idols first emerged in the 1990s through personal websites and blogs when Internet became more accessible, with some selling personal merchandise such as photo books through their websites.\n",

      "== Income ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Different types of Internet celebrities can make money in various ways, but most of them earn money from endorsements. Internet celebrities can use their fame to promote products or experiences to their followers, and are believed to provide credibility to products. In social media advertising, Internet celebrities can be paid to advertise products. When they have garnered sufficient attention and following, they can be approached by advertising companies to help advertise products and reach a wider audience. Endorsements for fashion and cosmetic products are common for Instagram internet influencers. YouTubers tend to advertise a wider array of products, regardless of relevance to their genre of content.\n",
      "YouTubers can also expand their source of revenue by creating their own products or merchandise to sell. Similarly, fashion bloggers and Instagram celebrities can earn money by promoting brands on their platforms or developing their own brands. Bloggers can feature sponsored posts in social media to make profits. For instance, fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni started as an online blogger, and then gained millions of followers on Instagram. She later created her brand, the Chiara Ferragni Collection. Like many other Instagram celebrities, Ferragni started by charging money per post for promoting brands. She now earns revenue from promotional Instagram posts and the sale of her own products.In 2020 a report by venture-capital firm SignalFire stated that the economy spawned by internet creators was the “fastest-growing type of small business.”\n",

      "=== Advertising regulations ===\n",
      "Due to the recent emergence of influencer culture, influencer marketing and advertising was initially left highly unregulated by previous existing legislation. This became a prevalent concern when users on social media platforms were finding it difficult to distinguish any differences between advertisements and sponsorships with personal posts. This was evident with the mismanagement of Fyre Festival, where numerous Instagram influencers were sanctioned for their lack of transparency. This led to a massive backlash from the public, who felt the promotion of the event deliberately misled and confused target audiences. As a result, numerous advertising bodies sought to introduce strict regulations and guidelines around influencer marketing. This includes the AANA (Australian Associations of National Advertisers), who states that influencer advertising must be \"clearly distinguishable\".\n",

      "== Cancel culture ==\n",
      "Cancel culture is a form of ostracism where an individual is excluded from social or professional circles because of past or present actions or allegations. The act may occur on social media platforms or in person. Cancel culture is a common term among Internet celebrities where they may lose their source of income, fans, or reputation because of their controversial actions. For example, Beauty Guru Youtuber Jeffree Star has faced many allegations and controversies in his career which include cyberbullying, vocally expressing racist remarks and slurs, etc. On July 10, 2020 the makeup brand Morphe cut ties and ceased all makeup collaborations with Jeffree Star because his problematic past had resurfaced.\n",

      "== Interacting with fans ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Meetups are often a way Internet celebrities interact with fans in real life. Occasionally, an Internet celebrity might organize a meetup and invite fans to meet them at a certain place and time without proper organization. This can attract crowds of fans, causing disorderly or even unsafe situations. For example, Tanacon was an organization produced in collaboration with talent manager Michael Weist involving a group of Internet celebrities who were set to meet paying fans, but did not follow through. Because of the disorganized setup, the meetup resulted in chaos.Alternatively, events can be organized at a venue with security personnel. VidCon is an annual organized video conference designed for people interested in online videos. It invites Internet content creators to participate in events for paying fans, such as performances, panels, and meet-and-greets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Effect on fans ==\n",
      "Internet celebrities can draw in a devoted crowd of fans whether their reach is small or wide. A scholarly article published from Thammasat University in Thailand explains that the younger generation is becoming more attracted to the path of fame compared to the typical intellectual development and financial security route. The appearance of the ease and simplicity of the life of internet celebrities obstructs the reality of what this life often really entails. Seeing influencers display the highlights of their lives has shown to produce some unintended effects on fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who closely follow the lives of internet celebrities are more likely to develop psychological difficulties such as anxiety, depression, and dissociation. Although many internet celebrities appreciate the support and loyalty of their viewers and fans, the dedication to their lives can sometimes be intense. Fans may develop extreme behaviors or attitudes towards their favorite celebrities that can be identified as obsessive or result in criminal behavior. The younger crowd of viewers are also being impacted through viewing internet celebrities on different social media platforms. The Journal of Behavioral Addictions published by Akademiai Kiado evaluates a study that was done on Hungarian adolescents to demonstrate these effects. The research found that the desire for fame on the internet was negatively associated with self-acceptance and potentially resulted in materialism and the desire for social recognition.\n",

      "What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
      "Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.\n",
      "Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experiences. In addition, data analytics companies often integrate third-party sentiment analysis APIs into their own customer experience management, social media monitoring, or workforce analytics platform, in order to deliver useful insights to their own customers.\n",
      "This article will explain how basic sentiment analysis works, evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of rules-based sentiment analysis, and outline the role of machine learning in sentiment analysis. Finally, we’ll explore the top applications of sentiment analysis before concluding with some helpful resources for further learning.\n",

      "The basics\n",
      "Basic sentiment analysis of text documents follows a straightforward process:\n",
      "\n",
      "Break each text document down into its component parts (sentences, phrases, tokens and parts of speech)\n",
      "Identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and component\n",
      "Assign a sentiment score to each phrase and component (-1 to +1)\n",
      "Optional: Combine scores for multi-layered sentiment analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "As you’ll see, the underlying technology is very complicated. But for a simple explanation of sentiment analysis, consider these sentences:\n",
      "Terrible pitching and awful hitting led to another crushing loss.\n",
      "Bad pitching and mediocre hitting cost us another close game.\n",
      "Both sentences discuss a similar subject, the loss of a baseball game. But you, the human reading them, can clearly see that first sentence’s tone is much more negative.\n",
      "Your brain figures this out by looking for and interpreting sentiment-bearing phrases – that is, words and phrases that carry a tone or opinion. These usually appear as adjective-noun combinations. In the examples above, the sentiment-bearing phrases are:\n",
      "Terrible pitching | awful hitting | crushing loss\n",
      "Bad pitching | mediocre hitting | close game\n",
      "You have encountered words like these many thousands of times over your lifetime across a range of contexts. And from these experiences, you’ve learned to understand the strength of each adjective, receiving input and feedback along the way from teachers and peers.\n",
      "When you read the sentences above, your brain draws on your accumulated knowledge to identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and interpret their negativity or positivity. Usually this happens subconsciously. For example, you instinctively know that a game that ends in a “crushing loss” has a higher score differential than the “close game”, because you understand that “crushing” is a stronger adjective than “close”.\n",
      "So, why are we using baseball games to explain how human brains do sentiment analysis? The answer is simple: computer sentiment analysis works (almost) the same way.\n",
      "What is a sentiment library?\n",
      "Much in the way your brain remembers the descriptive words you encounter over your lifetime and their relative “sentiment weight”, a basic sentiment analysis system draws on a sentiment library to understand the sentiment-bearing phrases it encounters.\n",
      "Sentiment libraries are very large collections of adjectives (good, wonderful, awful, horrible) and phrases (good game, wonderful story, awful performance, horrible show) that have been hand-scored by human coders. This manual sentiment scoring is a tricky process, because everyone involved needs to reach some agreement on how strong or weak each score should be relative to the other scores. If one person gives “bad” a sentiment score of -0.5, but another person gives “awful” the same score, your sentiment analysis system will conclude that that both words are equally negative.\n",
      "What’s more, a multilingual sentiment analysis engine must maintain unique libraries for each language it supports. And each of these libraries must be maintained constantly: scores tweaked, new phrases added, irrelevant phrases removed.\n",
      "Simple, rules-based sentiment analysis systems\n",
      "Once the sentiment libraries are prepared, software engineers write a series of guidelines (“rules”) to help the computer evaluate the sentiment expressed towards a particular entity (noun or pronoun) based on its nearness to known positive and negative words (adjectives and adverbs).\n",
      "To continue our baseball example, an engineer might create search rules that look like:\n",
      "(pitching) near (good, wonderful, spectacular)\n",
      "(pitching) near (bad, horrible, awful)\n",
      "These queries return a “hit count” representing how many times the word “pitching” appears near each adjective. The system then combines these hit counts using a complex mathematical operation called a “log odds ratio”. The outcome is a numerical sentiment score for each phrase, usually on a scale of -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).\n",
      "This is a simplified example, but it serves to illustrate the basic concepts behind rules-based sentiment analysis.\n",
      "Part of Speech tagging in sentiment analysis\n",
      "Even before you can analyze a sentence and phrase for sentiment, however, you need to understand the pieces that form it. The process of breaking a document down into its component parts involves several sub-functions, including Part of Speech (PoS) tagging.\n",
      "Part of Speech tagging is the process of identifying the structural elements of a text document, such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.\n",
      "[Read more about the 7 basic functions of text analytics]\n",
      "Most languages follow some basic rules and patterns that can be written into a computer program to power a basic Part of Speech tagger. In English, for example, a number followed by a proper noun and the word “Street” most often denotes a street address. A series of characters interrupted by an @ sign and ending with “.com”, “.net”, or “.org” usually represents an email address. Even people’s names often follow generalized two- or three-word patterns of nouns.\n",
      "Nouns and pronouns are most likely to represent named entities, while adjectives and adverbs usually describe those entities in emotion-laden terms. By identifying adjective-noun combinations, such as “terrible pitching” and “mediocre hitting”, a sentiment analysis system gains its first clue that it’s looking at a sentiment-bearing phrase. \n",
      "Of course, not every sentiment-bearing phrase takes an adjective-noun form. “Cost us”, from the example sentences earlier, is a noun-pronoun combination but bears some negative sentiment. \n",
      "Accurate part of speech tagging is critical for reliable sentiment analysis, so it’s important that a rules-based system account for these variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Diving deeper\n",
      "How negators and intensifiers affect sentiment analysis\n",
      "Consider a hotel review that reads,\n",
      "The bed was super comfy. The chair wasn’t bad, either.\n",
      "A simple rules-based sentiment analysis system will see that comfy describes bed and give the entity in question a positive sentiment score. But the score will be artificially low, even if it’s technically correct, because the system hasn’t considered the intensifying adverb super. When a customer likes their bed so much, the sentiment score should reflect that intensity.\n",
      "Even worse, the same system is likely to think that bad describes chair. This overlooks the key word wasn’t, which negates the negative implication and should change the sentiment score for chairs to positive or neutral.\n",
      "Here’s another example:\n",
      "The food was pretty good, but I won’t bother coming back.\n",
      "A simple rules-based sentiment analysis system will see that good describes food, slap on a positive sentiment score, and move on to the next review. \n",
      "But you (the human reader) can see that this review actually tells a different story. Even though the writer liked their food, something about their experience turned them off. This review illustrates why an automated sentiment analysis system must consider negators and intensifiers as it assigns sentiment scores.\n",
      "Drawbacks of rules-based sentiment analysis\n",
      "The simplicity of rules-based sentiment analysis makes it a good option for basic document-level sentiment scoring of predictable text documents, such as limited-scope survey responses. However, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system has many drawbacks that negate most of these advantages. A rules-based system must contain a rule for every word combination in its sentiment library. Creating and maintaining these rules requires tedious manual labor. And in the end, strict rules can’t hope to keep up with the evolution of natural human language. Instant messaging has butchered the traditional rules of grammar, and no ruleset can account for every abbreviation, acronym, double-meaning and misspelling that may appear in any given text document.\n",
      "In addition, a rules-based system that fails to consider negators and intensifiers is inherently naïve, as we’ve seen. Out of context, a document-level sentiment score can lead you to draw false conclusions. Lastly, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system is very delicate. When something new pops up in a text document that the rules don’t account for, the system can’t assign a score. In some cases, the entire program will break down and require an engineer to painstakingly find and fix the problem with a new rule.\n",
      "In the end, anyone who requires nuanced analytics, or who can’t deal with ruleset maintenance, should look for a tool that also leverages machine learning.\n",
      "Multi-layered sentiment analysis and why it is important\n",
      "Imagine a Yelp review that says,\n",
      "The linguini was great, but the room was way too dark.\n",
      "In this document, linguini is described by great, which deserves a positive sentiment score. But room is described negatively. Depending on the exact sentiment score each phrase is given, the two may cancel each other out and return neutral sentiment for the document.\n",
      "As this example demonstrates, document-level sentiment scoring paints a broad picture that can obscure important details. In this case, the culinary team loses a chance to pat themselves on the back. But more importantly, the general manager misses the crucial insight that she may be losing repeat business because customers don’t like her dining room ambience.\n",
      "Sophisticated sentiment analysis systems solve this problem by assigning sentiment scores not just to documents, but to individual entities, topics, themes and categories as well. The result is a system that, given the same Yelp review, can return:\n",
      "Entity sentiment: “linguini” (+0.5)\n",
      "Entity sentiment: “room” (-.25)\n",
      "Theme sentiment: “dark” (-.25)\n",
      "Category sentiment: “dining” (+.25)\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the positive entity sentiment of “linguini” and the negative sentiment of “room” would partially cancel each other out to influence a neutral sentiment of category “dining”. This multi-layered analytics approach reveals deeper insights into the sentiment directed at individual people, places, and things, and the context behind these opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine Learning\n",
      "How is machine learning used for sentiment analysis?\n",
      "The primary role of machine learning in sentiment analysis is to improve and automate the low-level text analytics functions that sentiment analysis relies on, including Part of Speech tagging. For example, data scientists can train a machine learning model to identify nouns by feeding it a large volume of text documents containing pre-tagged examples.

      "Broadly speaking, sentiment analysis is most effective when used as a tool for Voice of Customer and Voice of Employee. Business analysts, product managers, customer support directors, human resources and workforce analysts, and other stakeholders use sentiment analysis to understand how customers and employees feel about particular subjects, and why they feel that way.\n",
      "Sentiment analysis for voice of customer\n",
      "In the age of social media, a single viral review can burn down an entire brand. On the other hand, research by Bain & Co. shows that good experiences can grow 4-8% revenue over competition by increasing customer lifecycle 6-14x and improving retention up to 55%.\n",

      "Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.\n",
      "Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experiences. In addition, data analytics companies often integrate third-party sentiment analysis APIs into their own customer experience management, social media monitoring, or workforce analytics platform, in order to deliver useful insights to their own customers.\n",
      "This article will explain how basic sentiment analysis works, evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of rules-based sentiment analysis, and outline the role of machine learning in sentiment analysis. Finally, we’ll explore the top applications of sentiment analysis before concluding with some helpful resources for further learning.\n",
      "Basic sentiment analysis of text documents follows a straightforward process:\n",
      "As you’ll see, the underlying technology is very complicated. But for a simple explanation of sentiment analysis, consider these sentences:\n",
      "Both sentences discuss a similar subject, the loss of a baseball game. But you, the human reading them, can clearly see that first sentence’s tone is much more negative.\n",
      "Your brain figures this out by looking for and interpreting sentiment-bearing phrases – that is, words and phrases that carry a tone or opinion. These usually appear as adjective-noun combinations. In the examples above, the sentiment-bearing phrases are:\n",
      "Terrible pitching | awful hitting | crushing loss\n",
      "Bad pitching | mediocre hitting | close game\n",
      "You have encountered words like these many thousands of times over your lifetime across a range of contexts. And from these experiences, you’ve learned to understand the strength of each adjective, receiving input and feedback along the way from teachers and peers.\n",
      "When you read the sentences above, your brain draws on your accumulated knowledge to identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and interpret their negativity or positivity. Usually this happens subconsciously. For example, you instinctively know that a game that ends in a “crushing loss” has a higher score differential than the “close game”, because you understand that “crushing” is a stronger adjective than “close”.\n",
      "So, why are we using baseball games to explain how human brains do sentiment analysis? The answer is simple: computer sentiment analysis works (almost) the same way.\n",
      "Much in the way your brain remembers the descriptive words you encounter over your lifetime and their relative “sentiment weight”, a basic sentiment analysis system draws on a sentiment library to understand the sentiment-bearing phrases it encounters.\n",
      "Sentiment libraries are very large collections of adjectives (good, wonderful, awful, horrible) and phrases (good game, wonderful story, awful performance, horrible show) that have been hand-scored by human coders. This manual sentiment scoring is a tricky process, because everyone involved needs to reach some agreement on how strong or weak each score should be relative to the other scores. If one person gives “bad” a sentiment score of -0.5, but another person gives “awful” the same score, your sentiment analysis system will conclude that that both words are equally negative.\n",
      "What’s more, a multilingual sentiment analysis engine must maintain unique libraries for each language it supports. And each of these libraries must be maintained constantly: scores tweaked, new phrases added, irrelevant phrases removed.\n",
      "Once the sentiment libraries are prepared, software engineers write a series of guidelines (“rules”) to help the computer evaluate the sentiment expressed towards a particular entity (noun or pronoun) based on its nearness to known positive and negative words (adjectives and adverbs).\n",
      "To continue our baseball example, an engineer might create search rules that look like:\n",
      "(pitching) near (good, wonderful, spectacular)\n",
      "(pitching) near (bad, horrible, awful)\n",
      "These queries return a “hit count” representing how many times the word “pitching” appears near each adjective. The system then combines these hit counts using a complex mathematical operation called a “log odds ratio”. The outcome is a numerical sentiment score for each phrase, usually on a scale of -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).\n",
      "This is a simplified example, but it serves to illustrate the basic concepts behind rules-based sentiment analysis.\n",
      "Even before you can analyze a sentence and phrase for sentiment, however, you need to understand the pieces that form it. The process of breaking a document down into its component parts involves several sub-functions, including Part of Speech (PoS) tagging.\n",
      "Part of Speech tagging is the process of identifying the structural elements of a text document, such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.\n",
      "[Read more about the 7 basic functions of text analytics]\n",
      "Most languages follow some basic rules and patterns that can be written into a computer program to power a basic Part of Speech tagger. In English, for example, a number followed by a proper noun and the word “Street” most often denotes a street address. A series of characters interrupted by an @ sign and ending with “.com”, “.net”, or “.org” usually represents an email address. Even people’s names often follow generalized two- or three-word patterns of nouns.\n",
      "Nouns and pronouns are most likely to represent named entities, while adjectives and adverbs usually describe those entities in emotion-laden terms. By identifying adjective-noun combinations, such as “terrible pitching” and “mediocre hitting”, a sentiment analysis system gains its first clue that it’s looking at a sentiment-bearing phrase. \n",
      "Of course, not every sentiment-bearing phrase takes an adjective-noun form. “Cost us”, from the example sentences earlier, is a noun-pronoun combination but bears some negative sentiment. \n",
      "Accurate part of speech tagging is critical for reliable sentiment analysis, so it’s important that a rules-based system account for these variations.\n",
      "Consider a hotel review that reads,\n",
      "A simple rules-based sentiment analysis system will see that comfy describes bed and give the entity in question a positive sentiment score. But the score will be artificially low, even if it’s technically correct, because the system hasn’t considered the intensifying adverb super. When a customer likes their bed so much, the sentiment score should reflect that intensity.\n",
      "Even worse, the same system is likely to think that bad describes chair. This overlooks the key word wasn’t, which negates the negative implication and should change the sentiment score for chairs to positive or neutral.\n",
      "Here’s another example:\n",
      "A simple rules-based sentiment analysis system will see that good describes food, slap on a positive sentiment score, and move on to the next review. \n",
      "But you (the human reader) can see that this review actually tells a different story. Even though the writer liked their food, something about their experience turned them off. This review illustrates why an automated sentiment analysis system must consider negators and intensifiers as it assigns sentiment scores.\n",
      "The simplicity of rules-based sentiment analysis makes it a good option for basic document-level sentiment scoring of predictable text documents, such as limited-scope survey responses. However, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system has many drawbacks that negate most of these advantages. A rules-based system must contain a rule for every word combination in its sentiment library. Creating and maintaining these rules requires tedious manual labor. And in the end, strict rules can’t hope to keep up with the evolution of natural human language. Instant messaging has butchered the traditional rules of grammar, and no ruleset can account for every abbreviation, acronym, double-meaning and misspelling that may appear in any given text document.\n",
      "In addition, a rules-based system that fails to consider negators and intensifiers is inherently naïve, as we’ve seen. Out of context, a document-level sentiment score can lead you to draw false conclusions. Lastly, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system is very delicate. When something new pops up in a text document that the rules don’t account for, the system can’t assign a score. In some cases, the entire program will break down and require an engineer to painstakingly find and fix the problem with a new rule.\n",
      "In the end, anyone who requires nuanced analytics, or who can’t deal with ruleset maintenance, should look for a tool that also leverages machine learning.\n",
      "Imagine a Yelp review that says,\n",
      "In this document, linguini is described by great, which deserves a positive sentiment score. But room is described negatively. Depending on the exact sentiment score each phrase is given, the two may cancel each other out and return neutral sentiment for the document.\n",
      "As this example demonstrates, document-level sentiment scoring paints a broad picture that can obscure important details. In this case, the culinary team loses a chance to pat themselves on the back. But more importantly, the general manager misses the crucial insight that she may be losing repeat business because customers don’t like her dining room ambience.\n",
      "Sophisticated sentiment analysis systems solve this problem by assigning sentiment scores not just to documents, but to individual entities, topics, themes and categories as well. The result is a system that, given the same Yelp review, can return:\n",
      "In this case, the positive entity sentiment of “linguini” and the negative sentiment of “room” would partially cancel each other out to influence a neutral sentiment of category “dining”. This multi-layered analytics approach reveals deeper insights into the sentiment directed at individual people, places, and things, and the context behind these opinions.\n",
      "The primary role of machine learning in sentiment analysis is to improve and automate the low-level text analytics functions that sentiment analysis relies on, including Part of Speech tagging. For example, data scientists can train a machine learning model to identify nouns by feeding it a large volume of text documents containing pre-tagged examples. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and deep learning, the model will learn what nouns look like.\n",
      "Once the model is ready, the same data scientist can apply those training methods towards building new models to identify other parts of speech.

When a customer likes their bed so much, the sentiment score should reflect that intensity.\n",
      "Even worse, the same system is likely to think that bad describes chair. This overlooks the key word wasn’t, which negates the negative implication and should change the sentiment score for chairs to positive or neutral.\n",
      "Here’s another example:\n",
      "A simple rules-based sentiment analysis system will see that good describes food, slap on a positive sentiment score, and move on to the next review. \n",
      "But you (the human reader) can see that this review actually tells a different story. Even though the writer liked their food, something about their experience turned them off. This review illustrates why an automated sentiment analysis system must consider negators and intensifiers as it assigns sentiment scores.\n",
      "The simplicity of rules-based sentiment analysis makes it a good option for basic document-level sentiment scoring of predictable text documents, such as limited-scope survey responses. However, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system has many drawbacks that negate most of these advantages. A rules-based system must contain a rule for every word combination in its sentiment library. Creating and maintaining these rules requires tedious manual labor. And in the end, strict rules can’t hope to keep up with the evolution of natural human language. Instant messaging has butchered the traditional rules of grammar, and no ruleset can account for every abbreviation, acronym, double-meaning and misspelling that may appear in any given text document.\n",
      "In addition, a rules-based system that fails to consider negators and intensifiers is inherently naïve, as we’ve seen. Out of context, a document-level sentiment score can lead you to draw false conclusions. Lastly, a purely rules-based sentiment analysis system is very delicate. When something new pops up in a text document that the rules don’t account for, the system can’t assign a score. In some cases, the entire program will break down and require an engineer to painstakingly find and fix the problem with a new rule.\n",
      "In the end, anyone who requires nuanced analytics, or who can’t deal with ruleset maintenance, should look for a tool that also leverages machine learning.\n",
      "Imagine a Yelp review that says,\n",
      "In this document, linguini is described by great, which deserves a positive sentiment score. But room is described negatively. Depending on the exact sentiment score each phrase is given, the two may cancel each other out and return neutral sentiment for the document.\n",
      "As this example demonstrates, document-level sentiment scoring paints a broad picture that can obscure important details. In this case, the culinary team loses a chance to pat themselves on the back. But more importantly, the general manager misses the crucial insight that she may be losing repeat business because customers don’t like her dining room ambience.\n",
      "Sophisticated sentiment analysis systems solve this problem by assigning sentiment scores not just to documents, but to individual entities, topics, themes and categories as well. The result is a system that, given the same Yelp review, can return:\n",
      "In this case, the positive entity sentiment of “linguini” and the negative sentiment of “room” would partially cancel each other out to influence a neutral sentiment of category “dining”. This multi-layered analytics approach reveals deeper insights into the sentiment directed at individual people, places, and things, and the context behind these opinions.\n",
      "The primary role of machine learning in sentiment analysis is to improve and automate the low-level text analytics functions that sentiment analysis relies on, including Part of Speech tagging. For example, data scientists can train a machine learning model to identify nouns by feeding it a large volume of text documents containing pre-tagged examples. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and deep learning, the model will learn what nouns look like.\n",
      "Once the model is ready, the same data scientist can apply those training methods towards building new models to identify other parts of speech. The result is quick and reliable Part of Speech tagging that helps the larger text analytics system identify sentiment-bearing phrases more effectively.\n",
      "Machine learning also helps data analysts solve tricky problems caused by the evolution of language. For example, the phrase “sick burn” can carry many radically different meanings. Creating a sentiment analysis ruleset to account for every potential meaning is impossible. But if you feed a machine learning model with a few thousand pre-tagged examples, it can learn to understand what “sick burn” means in the context of video gaming, versus in the context of healthcare. And you can apply similar training methods to understand other double-meanings as well.\n",

      "Hybrid sentiment analysis systems combine machine learning with traditional rules to make up for the deficiencies of each approach.\n",
      "Rules-based sentiment analysis, for example, can be an effective way to build a foundation for PoS tagging and sentiment analysis. But as we’ve seen, these rulesets quickly grow to become unmanageable. This is where machine learning can step in to shoulder the load of complex natural language processing tasks, such as understanding double-meanings.\n",
      "Most hybrid sentiment analysis systems combine machine learning with software rules across the entire text analytics function stack, from low-level tokenization and syntax analysis all the way up to the highest-levels of sentiment analysis.\n",
      "[Read more about hybrid systems for sentiment analysis and natural language processing]\n",
      "Broadly speaking, sentiment analysis is most effective when used as a tool for Voice of Customer and Voice of Employee. Business analysts, product managers, customer support directors, human resources and workforce analysts, and other stakeholders use sentiment analysis to understand how customers and employees feel about particular subjects, and why they feel that way.\n",
      "In the age of social media, a single viral review can burn down an entire brand. On the other hand, research by Bain & Co. shows that good experiences can grow 4-8% revenue over competition by increasing customer lifecycle 6-14x and improving retention up to 55%.\n",
      "[Read more about sentiment analysis for Voice of Customer]\n",
      "Automated sentiment analysis tools are the key drivers of this growth. By analyzing tweets, online reviews and news articles at scale, business analysts gain useful insights into how customers feel about their brands, products and services. Customer support directors and social media managers flag and address trending issues before they go viral, while forwarding these pain points to product managers to make informed feature decisions.\n",
      "The cost of replacing a single employee averages 20-30% of salary, according to the Center for American Progress. Yet 20% of workers voluntarily leave their jobs each year, while another 17% are fired or let go. To combat this issue, human resources teams are turning to data analytics to help them reduce turnover and improve performance.\n",
