Novel Project

Project on Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer

## Introduction

We will be exploring the limits of Transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. This is a powerful technique in natural language processing. 

The project aims at identifying to which category the text belongs to, it could be sentiment analysis, text summarization or question answering.

## Reasons why we think this is a good project :

Published in Journal of Machine Learning Research 21 (2020) 1-67 (CORE ranking A*, Google Scholar venue ranking #96 in computational linguistics)
Cited by 1,731 papers, according to SEMANTIC SCHOLAR.
From Google’s researchers.

## Existed datasets:

Existed datasets can be found in the paper or github.
For the project we will be using the below datasets.

## Tasks to replicate:

Document Summarization 
Question Answering
Sentiment Analysis

## New data to be used for the project:

Dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/web-text-corpus). 
The dataset is in the form of text, which contains different genres and these have been scraped and collected from publicly accessible web posts. 
Some datasets used in the paper - Quora, CNN/Daily mail, WebText.
The project aims at identifying if the text is in a question-answer format or if it is a text summarization or any other text classification.
This dataset looks relevant to the dataset used in the project as it shows text classification and summarisation of text.

## Using Google’s virtual machine

We planned to use VM from Google cloud. The challenge for us is setting up TPU for VM.
The model was too heavy for VM so we used Colab.
